// The frontend message reader, and the field cursor every message body is
// decoded through.
//
// # Security posture
//
// This file is the only part of the package that reads bytes an unauthenticated
// remote peer chose, and it is written on the assumption that every one of them
// is hostile. Three properties are maintained, and each is maintained
// structurally rather than by remembering to check:
//
// First, no allocation is ever sized by a number the peer sent without that
// number having first been bounded against a constant. A frontend message
// declares its own length in a signed 32-bit field, which means the wire can
// carry a length of two gigabytes, a negative length, or a length smaller than
// the four bytes the field itself occupies. [reader.next] rejects all three
// before it reaches a make, and the accepted range is a compile-time constant
// ([maxMessageBody], or [maxStartupPacket] for the packet that arrives before
// authentication). The read buffer a session retains between messages is capped
// separately at [retainedBuffer], so a single oversized statement cannot leave
// an idle connection holding megabytes for the rest of its life.
//
// Second, no declared count is trusted against the bytes actually present.
// Bind declares a parameter count and then a length-prefixed value for each,
// and a message claiming 32767 parameters in a nine-byte body is a perfectly
// legal encoding of a lie. [fields.count] refuses a count whose elements cannot
// fit in what remains of the body, which turns that lie into an immediate
// protocol error instead of a large speculative slice. The same rule applies
// to every length-prefixed value: [fields.slice] compares against the remaining
// body, never against the message length.
//
// Third, a malformed body can never panic. The decoder is a cursor over a byte
// slice ([fields]) whose accessors bounds-check, return a zero value, and latch
// a failure flag; once latched it stays latched, so a caller that decodes six
// fields and checks once at the end is as safe as one that checks after each.
// No accessor slices without checking, no accessor can produce a negative
// length, and the cursor never holds an index that could go out of range. That
// is what makes [FuzzFrontendMessage] a meaningful test rather than a
// formality: arbitrary bytes must decode to a message or an error, and there is
// no third outcome available.
//
// What this file deliberately does not do is interpret. It produces a decoded
// message with its fields separated and nothing else checked — an unknown tag,
// a nonsensical format code, a Describe of neither 'S' nor 'P' are all reported
// as decode failures, but a valid Bind naming a portal that does not exist is
// not this layer's problem. Keeping policy out of the parser is what lets the
// parser be audited for memory safety in isolation.

// errMessageTooLarge is returned when a peer declares a message body larger
// than this server will read. It is a protocol violation rather than a resource
// error because the only way to produce one is to send a length no real client
// sends.
var errMessageTooLarge = errors.New("pgwire: frontend message is larger than this server accepts")

// errBadLength reports a message length field that cannot describe a message:
// negative, or smaller than the four bytes the field itself occupies.
var errBadLength = errors.New("pgwire: frontend message length field is not a valid length")

// errTruncated reports a message body that ended in the middle of a field.
var errTruncated = errors.New("pgwire: frontend message body ended inside a field")

// errUnterminated reports a string field with no terminating NUL byte.
var errUnterminated = errors.New("pgwire: frontend message string field is not NUL-terminated")

// errTrailing reports bytes left over after a message decoded successfully,
// which means the sender and this decoder disagree about the message's shape.
var errTrailing = errors.New("pgwire: frontend message has trailing bytes after its last field")

// errNameTooLong reports a prepared-statement or portal name past
// [maxIdentifier].
var errNameTooLong = errors.New("pgwire: prepared statement or portal name is too long")

// errImpossibleCount reports an element count larger than the remaining body
// could hold. It is separated from plain truncation because it is the signature
// of a deliberately malformed message rather than a short read.
