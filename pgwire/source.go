// A Source is a closed set of two shapes, and which one a server was built with
// decides which statements it can run. A heap [store.Database] holds many
// collections and produces a [store.DatabaseSnapshot], the consistent
// multi-collection cut a JOIN needs, so a database-backed server can serve a
// join. A single durable collection is one collection with no catalog, so a
// statement naming any other collection is an undefined table and a JOIN has
// no second side to read.
//
// The interface is closed — its method is unexported — because the set of
// things the query engine can execute against is closed. An open interface here
// would advertise an extension point that [query.Source] does not actually
// have.

// A Source supplies the collections a server's statements read. Construct one
// with [FromDatabase] or [FromCollection].

// A lease is one execution's resolved [query.Source] plus whatever must be
// released when its rows are done.
//
// The durable backend pins a generation for as long as a snapshot is open,
// which blocks the writer from reusing retired extents, so the snapshot is
// taken per execution and dropped when the portal's rows are exhausted or the
// portal is closed. That is the lifetime durable.Snapshot's own documentation
// asks for, and getting it wrong would not corrupt anything — it would quietly
// stop the writer from ever reclaiming space.
