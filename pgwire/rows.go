// RowDescription, DataRow, and the type mapping — the one genuinely new
// decision in this package.
//
// # Why every projected column is json (OID 114)
//
// RowDescription must declare one type OID per column before a single row has
// been read, and this store is schemaless: a path holds a number in one
// document and a string in the next, a projection has no declared type, and
// there is no moment at which the server could learn one that is not after the
// point where it has already had to answer. PostgreSQL has no "any" type in a
// result set, so a type must be picked that every value can honestly be.
//
// Four candidates were considered, and the constraint that decides between them
// is not expressiveness — it is which of them can be encoded in *both* wire
// formats without a chance of silent corruption.
//
// text (OID 25) is the obvious answer and is the wrong one. It is a lossy cast
// performed by the server: the string "123" and the number 123 both arrive as
// the three bytes "123", and a client has no way left to tell them apart. In a
// store whose whole point is that a path's type is per-document, erasing type
// at the boundary erases the only information the client needed.
//
// numeric (OID 1700) is right for an aggregate and impossible for a projection,
// which may not be a number at all. It also has a nontrivial binary encoding —
// a base-10000 digit vector with a weight, a sign, and a display scale — and
// this package has no PostgreSQL to validate an implementation of it against.
// Shipping an unvalidated numeric_send is precisely the failure the format
// question is dangerous for: a subtly wrong digit grouping produces a number
// the client accepts and misreads. It is not used here.
//
// jsonb (OID 3802) describes a normalized document: PostgreSQL's jsonb sorts
// object keys, drops duplicate keys, and does not preserve number spelling.
// This engine preserves all three — key order, duplicates, and the document's
// exact decimal digits — so declaring jsonb would be declaring a normalization
// that did not happen.
//
// json (OID 114) is what these values actually are. It is the only candidate
// whose domain contains every kind a cell can hold: null, boolean, number,
// string, array, and object all have a JSON spelling, and the spelling is the
// document's own bytes rather than a re-rendering. Exact decimal survives
// because a projected number's text is the digits the document was written
// with; nothing passes through float64 on this path. Containers, which have no
// scalar OID at all, need no special case. And — the property that settles it —
// json's *binary* format is byte-for-byte its text format. PostgreSQL's
// json_send emits the value's text with no header, no length, and no
// transformation, so a client asking for binary and a client asking for text
// receive the same bytes, and there is no encoder here that could get binary
// subtly wrong. Binary is therefore supported for every column this server can
// produce rather than refused, which removes the worst failure mode available
// instead of documenting it.
//
// The exception is COUNT, which is declared int8 (OID 20). A row tally is
// genuinely an int64 — it is the one column in this dialect with a real static
// type — and clients want to scan it into an integer rather than through a JSON
// decoder. int8's binary format is eight big-endian bytes, which is the other
// encoding this package can be certain of.
//
// # What the mapping costs
//
// A string arrives JSON-quoted. `SELECT name` yields `"alice"`, seven bytes,
// not five. Clients that understand OID 114 — psycopg, node-postgres, pgx —
// parse it back into a native string automatically; a client that treats every
// column as raw text sees the quotes. That is the price of not erasing the
// difference between the string "123" and the number 123, and it is paid in a
// place the client can undo.
//
// A client's JSON decoder may narrow a number that this server did not. The
// bytes on the wire are exact — 9007199254740993 is sent as those seventeen
// digits — but a JavaScript client parsing them with JSON.parse gets a float64
// and loses the last digit. That loss is the client's decoder, not this
// encoding, and it is avoidable on every client by reading the column as raw
// text or as a lazy JSON value. Declaring numeric would have moved the loss
// rather than removed it, because a schemaless column cannot be declared
// numeric in the first place.
//
// SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX are json rather than numeric, so a client that wants
// a decimal type gets a JSON number. There is a second, larger caveat that
// belongs to the engine and not to this package: a computed aggregate that is
// not an integer is held as a float64 inside [query.Cell] and formatted from
// there, so AVG's exactness is bounded by float64 before this code ever sees
// it. Projected numbers, which are the ones the exactness guarantee is about,
// keep their document bytes and are unaffected.
//
// # Absent, null, and NULL
//
// This engine defines an absent path and an explicit JSON null as one value:
// both produce a null cell and both satisfy IS NULL. The protocol has exactly
// one NULL, encoded as a length of -1, and that is what both become. The
// distinction is not destroyed, it is simply not carried by the value: a client
// that needs it asks for it in the statement, with this dialect's IS MISSING,
// which is true only for a path that resolves to nothing.
//
// One consequence is worth stating because it surprises people: a NULL from
// this server never means "the JSON literal null was stored here" and never
// means "the field was absent". It means one of the two and does not say which.

// A columnType is how one result column is declared on the wire.
type columnType struct {
	oid int32

// every type here.
//
// The format code in each field must be the format the DataRow will actually
