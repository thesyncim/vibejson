	// unusually expensive to scan knows something this package cannot, and both

//
// The ring is what makes batch storage reusable without a pool or a free list,
// and its correctness rests entirely on the credit protocol. Write C for the
// credit channel's capacity and L = C+1 for the ring's length.
//
// The scanner sends one credit and then publishes one batch, with nothing
// between the two that can fail or return, so the number of credits held is
// exactly (batches published) - (batches whose credit the consumer has
// released). The consumer releases a batch's credit only after consuming its
// partial in sequence order. Therefore, at the moment the scanner takes the slot
// for sequence t, sequences 0..t-1 have been published and at most C of them are
// unconsumed — so every unconsumed sequence lies in [t-C, t-1]. Those, together
// with t itself, are C+1 = L consecutive sequences, which occupy L distinct
// slots modulo L. Sequence t-L = t-C-1 is outside the window and has therefore
// been scanned, reduced, and consumed: nothing still refers to the slot about to
// be rewound.
//
// The +1 is load-bearing and measured, not conservative:
// TestRunFileSnapshotBatchRingReuseDifferential fails at both C/2+1 and exactly
// C. The bound is stated in credits rather than in workers because the credit
// channel is what actually enforces it — the executor derives L from
// cap(pool.credits), so a pool whose channels were built for a different width
// cannot leave the two disagreeing.
//
// Reusing the pool across executions does not weaken any of this. The credit
// channel is empty at the start of every execution (see filePool for why),
// so the count of held credits starts at zero exactly as it did when the channel
// was minted per call.
//
// Only storage the consumer copies out of belongs here. A projected row's
// detached scalars and a group's accumulators do not: the consumer retains those
// until the execution materializes its Result, so they live in the per-worker
// fileArena, which is rewound at the start of an execution and retired by a
