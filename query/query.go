// Package query is a typed query engine over a
// [store.Segment], heap [store.Snapshot], or a durable snapshot: the product
// layer that turns indexing, projection,
// containment, and grouping primitives into one compiled plan with a
// programmatic builder and an optional SQL front end. Each document is one row
// and columns are JSON paths. It answers SELECT of path projections and
// aggregates
// (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX); WHERE with comparisons, containment (@>),
// existence, and null tests combined by And/Or/Not; cross-collection
// semi-joins; GROUP BY; ORDER BY; and
// LIMIT. Subqueries, mutation, and full SQL are out of scope, as is any join
// that returns the joined collection's columns — see [Join].
//
// The builder, the JSON document front end, and the optional SQL parser are
// front ends for one immutable compiled plan, cached inside the [Query] that
// produced it. Compiling resolves paths to compiled pointers and numeric
// slots, predicates to typed operators, and literals to typed constants. The
// query text and the builder tree are then discarded; none of them is
// interpreted during execution:
//
//	q := query.Select(query.Path("name"), query.Sum("score")).
//		Where(query.Cmp("active", query.Eq, true)).
//		GroupBy("team").
//		OrderBy("team", query.Asc).
//		Limit(10)
//	result, err := q.Run(query.FromSegment(&docs))
//
// A query is also expressible as a JSON document, so one can be stored,
// logged, or received over a wire and compiled to the same plan. [New] takes
// that document as Go literals and [Parse] takes it as JSON text. Sibling keys
// conjoin, which is what makes the common all-of filter read as data rather
// than as a tree of constructors:
//
//	q, err := query.New(query.M{
//		"select":  query.A{"team", query.M{"total": query.M{"$sum": "score"}}},
//		"where":   query.M{"active": true, "tier": query.M{"$in": query.A{"pro", "team"}}},
//		"groupBy": "team",
//		"orderBy": query.A{query.M{"total": "desc"}},
//		"limit":   10,
//	})
//
// [New] and [Parse] own everything they return. A service compiling a query
// document per request instead holds a [Compiler], whose arenas a warmed
// compilation refills rather than reallocates, making a steady-state compile
// free of heap allocation the same way a warmed [Query.RunInto] is. The Query
// it produces borrows that compiler and is valid until its next compile, the
// borrowed-lifetime rule [Result] and [Workspace] already carry.
//
// Execution has exactly two entry points. [Query.Run] answers a one-off, and
// [Query.RunInto] runs into a caller-owned [Exec] that retains the destination
// Result, the scratch Workspace, the durable backend's options, and its
// reported stats. Both take a [Source], the discriminated handle naming the
// collection: [FromSegment], [FromSnapshot], [FromFile], or [FromDatabase]. One
// backend is therefore never a different call shape from another, and a hot
// loop is one Exec reused:
//
//	var e query.Exec
//	err = q.RunInto(&e, query.FromSnapshot(snapshot))
//
// A query with a [Join] clause reads a second collection, and takes
// [FromDatabase] so both sides come from one [store.DatabaseSnapshot] — the
// consistent cut that makes snapshot skew across a join inexpressible rather
// than merely discouraged.
//
// The clause is one of two operators, and which one is what it declares. Without
// [Join.As] it is a semi-join: it filters the driving collection by the
// existence of a partner, returns no column of the joined side, and keeps a
// driving row once however many documents match it. Which strategy answers that
// — a membership pushed into the driving predicate, a per-row keyed lookup, or
// that lookup behind a Bloom prefilter — is measured at execution rather than
// estimated, and reported in [ExecStats].
//
// With [Join.As] it is SQL's inner join: the joined collection is named, its
// columns are projectable, orderable, groupable, and reducible through that
// name, and the result carries one row per matching pair in driving-ordinal and
// then joined-ordinal order. See [Join], join.go, join_bloom.go, and
// join_build.go.
//
// [PrepareSQL] produces an identically compiled Query directly from SQL, and
// [Query.Prepare] forces compilation eagerly so a malformed query fails where
// it was written. [PrepareStatement] is the fuller SQL entry point: it returns
// a [Statement], which adds the three things a plan cannot carry — output names
// from AS aliases, '?' placeholders bound per execution, and the HAVING and
// OFFSET clauses the executor has no node for. A Statement owns its own
// [Compiler], so re-binding a placeholder rebuilds the plan without allocating.
// The vibesql package exposes it as a database/sql driver and lists in one
// place every way this dialect and SQL disagree. Output has stable ordinal IDs through [Query.AppendSchema],
// and [Cell] exposes typed values plus caller-buffered [Cell.AppendJSON]. A
// transport encoder can therefore consume typed batches without header lookup
// or intermediate string formatting. Field-name bytes remain only in immutable compiled-path
// metadata because schemaless JSON has no external schema ID to replace them.
//
// The executor is column-oriented. Without an applicable posting bound it
// extracts each needed path as a dense column and evaluates WHERE in one full
// scan. With a selective bound it pushes the posting ordinals into extraction:
// [store.ShapeCache.AppendFieldRows] and
// [store.Segment.AppendPointerRows] gather only candidate cells, then the
// same compiled predicate rechecks them exactly before reduction, grouping,
// ordering, and limiting. A compiled query is immutable and safe to run
// concurrently; Run owns its transient scan state, while concurrent RunInto
// calls use one independent Exec per goroutine.
// A [FromFile] execution first late-binds exact persistent indexes. A bounded
// plan admits only its collision-rechecked stable-slot masks; an unbounded plan
// scans every row. It then indexes bounded raw batches in parallel, restores
// source order before partial reductions, and externally merges ordered
// projections or groups when their transient frontier reaches the configured
// memory target. The caller owns the final result, whose size is necessarily
// outside that working-memory target.
//
// # Value semantics
//
// The engine defines the following, so results are predictable across every
// document shape:
//
//   - An absent path and an explicit JSON null are one value, "null". IsNull
//     tests for it; Exists distinguishes a present null from an absent path.
//   - Comparisons are within type. Numbers compare by exact decimal value —
//     1, 1.0, and 1e2 versus 100 compare as equals, and integers past
//     float64's mantissa stay distinct — strings by decoded content, bools by
//     value. Across types there is a defined total order (null < bool <
//     number < string < container) for ORDER BY and GROUP BY, and inequality
//     for =/!=; a null or absent value never satisfies a comparison.
//   - SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX skip null and non-numeric values and are null
//     over an empty input. COUNT(path) counts present, non-null values;
//     COUNT(*) counts rows.
//   - Duplicate object keys resolve to the last occurrence, matching the
//     core's Node.Get.
