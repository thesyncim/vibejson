// The durable chunk-summary probe is on the query path, so it is held to the
// same contract as everything else there: a warm execution allocates nothing
// that scales with the collection, and probing the summaries allocates nothing
// at all.
//
// The distinction matters because the probe walks a radix tree with a
// callback, and a closure that escapes would put its captured mask buffer,
// counter, and decoded summary on the heap once per directory page rather than
// once per process. That is exactly the shape of regression a plain
// correctness test cannot see.

// zoneAllocCorpus is a clustered page-backed corpus with no declared index, so
// every predicate below reaches the chunk-summary tier rather than an index.

// This is TestFileExecutionSteadyAllocs's contract applied to the one thing
// that harness's corpus cannot reach. Its `bucket` values repeat in every
// chunk, so its probes walk the summaries, prune nothing, and report
// unbounded — which exercises the walk and the decode but never the branch
// that appends a surviving chunk's mask, intersects it with an index mask, or
// hands a narrowed mask set to the scanner. The corpus here is clustered and
// the predicate selects 0.1% of it, so every one of those runs on every
// execution.
//
// It borrows scanAllocsPerRun deliberately rather than reading MemStats
// directly: an earlier version of this test divided a single window by its run
// count and reported 2 allocations at 20k documents and 4 at 100k on a path
// that allocates nothing, because a process-wide counter over an undivided
// window is mostly the runtime's own goroutines. The differenced,
// collector-paused, cheapest-of-thirty form is what makes a budget of zero
