// durableScanCorpus builds a page-backed snapshot of n documents carrying no
// persistent index at all. That is the shape the general batched executor
// exists for: every pushdown lane declines, so the query admits and parses the
// whole corpus in worker batches, which is the path whose per-document cost
// this file pins down.
//
// The document is deliberately wide. A batch's scan Segment indexes one
// structural entry per key and per value, its entry arena stops doubling at
// 65,536 entries, and its source arena stops at one mebibyte — so a document of
// six flat fields lets a default 4,096-row batch fit inside one generation of
// each and never exercise the arena recycling at all. Eighteen fields at about
// three hundred bytes puts a batch at roughly 151,000 entries and 1.2 MB of
// source, which crosses both ceilings, which is the case that was silently
// re-buying a megabyte of arena per batch forever. A fixture that fits is a
// fixture that proves nothing about real documents.

// scanAllocsPerRun reports what runs additional warm executions of q over
// snapshot cost, in heap allocations and bytes. It reads MemStats rather than
// using testing.AllocsPerRun because the batched executor runs on scanner and
// worker goroutines, which AllocsPerRun's single-goroutine accounting does not
// see — the very allocations this file is about.
//
// It is a *marginal* measurement: two windows are timed, one of runs executions
// and one of twice that, and the answer is the difference. That is what makes a
// budget of zero meaningful. MemStats is process-wide and the measurement is not
// free of the process — ReadMemStats stops the world, and starting it again can
// cost the runtime a machine descriptor — so a window pays a small fixed cost
// once, whatever it contains. Measured here as exactly one 112-byte allocation
// per window, systematically, on a path that allocates nothing. Subtracting a
// short window from a long one cancels that exactly, while anything an execution
// does survives multiplied by the extra executions.
//
// Reporting the difference rather than a per-execution average is the other half
// of it. Dividing by the run count would turn up to runs-1 real allocations into
// a reported zero, which is how a shape that allocated on nearly every execution
// could pass a test whose message says it allocated on none.
//
// The cheapest of several attempts is taken, because two of the retained buffers
// converge over several executions rather than one: the scan Segment's arena
// free list needs a fill to supersede a generation and a Reset to release it
// before a later fill can draw on it, and a worker's row arena is sized by the
// share of batches that worker wins, which the scheduler redistributes from run
// to run. Both are monotone and bounded, so a path that really allocates nothing
// reaches a zero attempt; a path that allocates per row or per batch has none,
// because every attempt pays for every execution in it.

// buffers, the per-worker Workspace, the per-worker scan Segment and its arena
// generations, the per-worker row and group arena, the batch ring, the merge
// frontier, the aggregate accumulators, the result cells — and the scanner, the
// workers, and the four channels between them, which are parked in the Exec's
// pool rather than minted per call. Nothing is left to buy.
//
// Both budgets are checked, because each catches what the other cannot. The
// count catches a small per-row or per-group allocation, which is invisible in
// bytes. The byte budget catches a handful of enormous ones, which is invisible
// in the count: a scan Segment whose entry arena outgrows its ceiling used to
// discard a whole megabyte per batch, which on a 13-batch execution is 25 MB
// hiding behind 25 allocations — a number no sane count budget would ever flag.
// The byte budget is not exactly zero only because MemStats is process-wide and
// picks up whatever the runtime's own goroutines do during the window; it sits
// three orders of magnitude below one arena generation, which is the thing it
// exists to catch.
//
// The shapes differ in what they retain past the batch that produced them, which
// is the whole difficulty: an aggregate keeps a fixed number of accumulators, a
// projection keeps every selected row's detached bytes, an ordered projection
// keeps them and sorts them, and a grouped reduction keeps one key, one scalar
