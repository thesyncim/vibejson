// The mutation and definition front end: a parsed INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
// CREATE TABLE, or CREATE INDEX lowered to the values a storage layer can act
// on.
//
// This package does not write. It has no collection handle, no writer lock, and
// no opinion about durability, and adding one would make the query engine the
// owner of a transaction boundary it cannot see the other half of. What it owns
// is the half that is genuinely its: deciding which documents a statement acts
// on, and doing so with the same compiled predicate a SELECT would use.
//
// # Which documents, and why the answer is the SELECT executor's
//
// A DELETE has to remove exactly the documents the equivalent SELECT returns.
// That is not a nice property, it is the only defensible one: a store where
// "SELECT ... WHERE p" and "DELETE ... WHERE p" disagreed about a null, an
// absent path, or a NOT over either would destroy data on the disagreement.
//
// The obvious implementation — walk the parsed predicate and test each document
// — would be a second evaluator, and a second evaluator is a second set of
// answers to every question the first one already answered: three-valued
// negation, cross-type comparison order, duplicate keys resolving to the last
// occurrence, exact-decimal numeric equality. So there is no second evaluator.
// [DMLStatement.Filter] feeds documents through the compiled plan's own filter
// phase, in batches, on a scratch Segment — the identical arrangement the
// durable backend already uses to filter a batch of raw pages — and reports the
// rows it selects. The predicate that runs is the predicate a SELECT would have
// run, because it is the same compiled predicate reached through the same call.
//
// # What this costs
//
// A filtered DELETE or UPDATE is a full scan. The candidate pruning a SELECT
// gets from persistent indexes happens before the scan, against a snapshot's
// index directory, and is bound to the backend's own execution entry point;
// this path is fed documents by a caller that has already chosen how to
// enumerate them. That is a real performance difference and it is stated rather
// than hidden: a DELETE over an indexed path reads every document, where the
// SELECT with the same WHERE reads the ones the index admits.
//
// The exception is a primary-key condition, which the parser splits out for
// exactly this reason: `DELETE FROM t WHERE "$key" = ?` never scans at all.

// and the selection written back all want to stay in cache, and a batch large
// enough to spill them turns a filter pass into a memory-bandwidth problem. A
// batch far smaller would pay the per-pass setup — the Segment reset, the
// column classification — once per handful of documents instead of once per
// cache-sized run.

// a collection of megabyte documents does not build a 256-megabyte scratch
// Segment to filter 256 rows.

// A Filter feeds documents through a prepared statement's WHERE and reports the
// ones it selects.
//
// A caller enumerates its own collection — which is the only arrangement that
// works for both an in-memory snapshot and a page-backed one, and the only one
// that lets a caller overlay a transaction's own uncommitted writes on the scan
// — and hands each document to [Filter.Add]. Matching documents are reported to
// the visit function in the order they were added.
//
// Both key and doc are copied on the way in, so a caller may hand over the
// borrowed bytes a page-backed scan yields without cloning them first. They are
// []byte rather than string for exactly that reason: a durable scan hands its
// callback borrowed bytes, and a string parameter would make every document in
// the collection pay one heap allocation to be rejected by the predicate. The
// key and doc a visit receives borrow the Filter's own batch buffers and are
// valid until the next Add; a visitor that keeps either copies it.
//
// A Filter is single-consumer and is owned by the [DMLStatement] that made it:
// its batch buffers and scratch Segment are retained across executions, which
// is what keeps a prepared mutation's scan cost constant rather than
// proportional to how many times it has run, and which means one statement has
