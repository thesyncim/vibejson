// Parallel filter phase for the in-memory backends.
//
// Only the filter phase is split. That is not a staging decision, it is what
// makes the parallelism free of ordering risk: the phase's whole output is a
// selection of row ordinals, workers own disjoint ascending ranges of those
// ordinals, and concatenating their selections in range order reproduces
// exactly the order one goroutine would have produced. Everything after the
// selection — the late gather, ordering, grouping, aggregation, and result
// materialization — stays on the calling goroutine and is untouched, so
// ORDER BY stability and the source-ordinal ordering of an unordered
// projection are the same guarantees they were before.
//
// The scalar columns are the one thing workers share, and they share them by
// writing disjoint index ranges of one pre-sized column. That is not a race:
// distinct elements of a slice are distinct memory, and no worker reads
// another's range. Keeping the columns shared is what lets the late phase's
// compaction work on one dense column, rather than having to stitch per-worker
// columns back together in a pass that would cost what the split saved.

// A scanWorker is one goroutine's share of a parallel filter phase.
//
// Every mutable thing the phase touches is per worker: the shape cache, the raw
// gather buffers, the snapshot address list, the decoded-text arena, the
// containment index scratch, and the local selection. That is not contention
// avoidance, it is the [Workspace] contract — a Workspace is single-consumer,
// and sharing any one of these would be a data race rather than a slow path.
// The buffers live in the Workspace across executions for the same reason every
// other buffer does: a warmed execution must allocate nothing, and allocating
// per worker per batch would put the allocation back one level down.

// parallelScanMinRows is the smallest scan the default policy will split, and
// parallelScanRowsPerWorker is how much of one a worker must be given before
// another is added. Below the minimum, starting and joining goroutines costs
// more than the scan does, and a split is a straight regression on the small
// queries an interactive workload is mostly made of.
//
// Both numbers come from BenchmarkSegmentParallel and BenchmarkNarrowRowParallel,
// measured on 16 processors. The crossover moves with how much work a row is,
// so the threshold is placed against the cheaper of the two corpora — a
// two-field row, where per-row work is at its floor and the fixed cost of
// splitting is at its most visible. ns/doc for a one-percent filter:
//
//	rows    narrow row              wide row (21 fields)
//	        w=1    w=2    w=4       w=1    w=2    w=4
//	  256   31.4   39.7   36.6      60.8   70.2   46.9
//	  512   31.0   34.8   24.3      58.5   49.1   40.4
