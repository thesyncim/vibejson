// The reusable compilation front end.
//
// Compiling a query document used to cost roughly seventy allocations spread
// evenly over the whole lowering — the predicate nodes, the compiled paths,
// the needle tapes, the literals' decimal spellings, the headers, and the path
// registry's map. No single one dominated, so no point fix could reach the
// zero-allocation steady state the rest of this package already offers through
// RunInto and Workspace. A Compiler is the same answer applied to compilation:
// caller-owned storage that a warmed compile refills instead of reallocating.
//
// Every arena here is a chunkArena rather than an append-grown slice. A plan
// is a graph of interior pointers — a *compiledPredicate points at a node, a
// scalar's num field points at a literal's digits, a string points at interned
// bytes — and append's reallocation would move the backing array out from
// under every one of them, leaving a plan whose nodes alias storage the
// compiler has since handed to someone else. Chunks are never resized once
// allocated, so an issued pointer stays valid for as long as the compiler is
// not rewound.

// A Compiler compiles query documents with reusable storage. Its zero value is
// ready to use. It is single-consumer and not safe for concurrent use.
//
// Compiling into dst invalidates whatever dst held before, and a Query
// compiled by a Compiler borrows that compiler's storage: it is valid only
// until the next compile with the same Compiler (or until [Compiler.Release]).
// This is the same borrowed-lifetime rule [Result] and [Workspace] already
// carry, for the same reason — the storage that makes the steady state
// allocation-free is the storage the previous answer is still pointing at. Two
// Queries produced by one Compiler therefore cannot be used at the same time;
// give each long-lived Query its own Compiler, or compile it with the
// package-level [Parse] and [New], which own everything they return.
//
// A Query a Compiler produced is still safe to execute concurrently, exactly
// like any other compiled Query: the plan it borrows is immutable for as long
// as it is valid, and execution state lives in one [Exec] per goroutine. What
// is not safe is compiling with the Compiler while one of its Queries runs.
//
// A first compile cannot be literally allocation-free — the Query owns its
// paths, headers, literals, and needles, and the arenas have to come from
// somewhere. The contract is zero steady-state allocation: after one warm-up
// compile of comparable shape, every later compile refills the same chunks.
