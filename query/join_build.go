// The fan-out build side.
//
// A semi-join asks whether a driving row has a partner, and this package
// answers that without ever producing one: a collected set searched per row, or
// a keyed probe behind a Bloom filter. An inner join asks which partners, and
// that question has no answer that avoids materializing them — the result
// carries one row per matching pair, so the pairs have to exist.
//
// So a fan-out clause abandons the strategy choice entirely and builds the one
// structure that can answer it: every surviving joined row, addressed by its
// join value. It is a hash multimap rather than a sorted set because the same
// structure has to serve two questions — "is there a partner" for the filter
// phase and "which partners" for the expansion — and a chain walk answers both
// from one lookup.
//
// # Why the entries are not deduplicated
//
// The semi-join's set is deduplicated, and it has to be: two joined documents
// with one key must not select the driving row twice. Here the opposite is
// required. Two joined documents with one key are two output rows, and that is
// the whole difference between the two operators. The build therefore keeps one
// entry per surviving joined row, and the dedup that makes a membership cheap
// is exactly what would make this wrong.
//
// # Ordering
//
// Pairs are produced in driving-ordinal order, and within one driving row in
// ascending joined-row address order. Both halves are structural rather than
// incidental. The outer half is the expansion walking the selection, which the
// filter phase already produced in ascending scan order — including across
// workers, whose ranges are concatenated in range order. The inner half is
// bucket chains built back to front (see index), so walking a chain forward
// yields the entries in the order the inner scan appended them, which is the
// joined collection's own stable chunk and slot order.
//
// That rule is what makes a fan-out result reproducible, and what lets the
// exhaustive differential compare it against a naive nested loop that simply
// walks both collections in order.

// joinBuildEmpty marks the end of a bucket chain and an empty bucket. It is
// -1 rather than 0 because 0 is a valid entry index, and a sentinel that
// collides with a real one would silently truncate the first entry's chain.
const joinBuildEmpty = int32(-1)

// A joinBuild is one fan-out clause's materialized joined side: every row that
// survived the clause's own filter, in the joined collection's scan order,

//
// Its storage lives in the executing [Workspace] and is reused across
// executions like every other buffer here. That reuse is what keeps a fan-out
// join allocation-free in the steady state, which matters more here than
// anywhere else in this package: a fan-out produces more rows than the driving
// collection has, so anything allocated per pair would scale with the output.
