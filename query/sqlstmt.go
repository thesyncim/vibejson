// The prepared-statement front end: a parsed [sqlast.SelectStmt] lowered onto
// the same compiled plan the programmatic builder produces.
//
// The layer exists because a database/sql driver needs three things the plan
// alone does not carry. It needs output names, which belong to the result
// schema rather than to the plan (an AS alias renames a column without changing
// a byte of execution). It needs placeholder binding, which means a statement's
// literals are not known until execution and the plan must be rebuilt per bind.
// And it needs the two clauses the executor has no node for — HAVING and
// OFFSET — applied somewhere, because the parser accepts both and silently
// dropping either returns wrong rows.
//
// Rebuilding the plan per bind is the reason a Statement owns a [Compiler]
// rather than borrowing one. A Compiler's arenas are refilled by a warmed
// compile instead of reallocated, so the steady state of "bind, execute, bind,
// execute" allocates nothing; but a Query it produced is invalidated by its
// next compile, so two statements sharing one Compiler would invalidate each
// other's plan the moment both were prepared. One Compiler per Statement makes
// the lifetime rule "a Statement's plan is valid until that Statement's next
// bind", which is a rule a caller can actually hold to.

// A Statement is a prepared SQL statement: the parsed tree, the compiled plan
// it lowers to, and the output schema the plan does not carry.
//
// It is single-consumer and not safe for concurrent use, for the same reason
// [Compiler] and [Exec] are: it holds the storage that makes a warmed
// bind-and-execute allocation-free, and two goroutines binding one Statement
// would interleave writes into a single plan. A pool of connections gives each
// connection its own Statement.
//
// A Statement with no '?' placeholder compiles exactly once, at
// [PrepareStatement], and every later execution reuses that plan without
// touching the parser or the compiler again. A Statement with placeholders
// re-lowers on each bind; after one warm-up that re-lowering is free of heap
// allocation, but it is not free of work, and the difference is measurable.
// See the package benchmarks.
