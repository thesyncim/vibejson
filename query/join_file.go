// The durable join's inner side.
//
// A join has two halves and they meet the durable backend very differently.
//
// The driving half needs nothing new. runFileSnapshotBatched already
// materializes each batch of documents into a per-worker store.Segment and runs
// the ordinary columnar filter over it, so a predInBound leaf on the driving
// side is evaluated by exactly the code the heap backend uses, against exactly
// the same binding. All that had to be added there is pointing each worker's
// evaluator at the shared bindings — which is the same read-only/per-worker
// split selectSegmentParallel already performs, and which the durable executor
// gets for free because each of its workers already owns a Workspace.
//
// The inner half is where the work is. The heap binder reads its inner
// collection through gathered columnar extraction at stable row addresses; a
// durable snapshot has no such gather, because its rows live in evictable page
// frames and every read copies out. What it does have is an ordered scan that
// yields (key, value) per selected row. So the inner side here is rebuilt on
// that scan, and it deliberately funnels back into the heap path as early as it
// can: a batch of scanned documents is appended into a store.Segment and then
// filtered by the same plan, the same extraction, and the same selectRows the
// heap binder uses.
//
// That funnel is the reason the two backends agree. The alternative — a second
// implementation of inner filtering that reads the durable snapshot directly —
// would have been faster by one document copy per inner row and would have had
// to be kept semantically identical to the heap's by hand, forever, across
// every predicate kind. Reusing the Segment path makes agreement structural:
// the differential tests compare two spellings of the scan, not two evaluators.
//
// Ordering is preserved for the same reason. RangeMasksRawBuffer visits rows in
// ascending chunk and slot order, which is the order the heap binder's mask
// walk produces, so a batch's rows arrive in the same sequence and the
// collected set — and, for a fan-out clause, the build's entry order — matches
// the heap's element for element.

// # The thresholds, re-measured
//
// joinMembershipMax and joinBloomScanRatio were both measured against the heap
// backend, and neither number transfers by assumption. This is what
// BenchmarkDurableJoinCostModel measures on the durable one (Apple M4 Max, Go
// 1.26, warm page cache, 20,000 driving rows, ns per row, three-arm method
// identical to BenchmarkJoinCostModel's — probe cost is the joined scan minus
// the unjoined one):
//
//	inner collection   inner row scanned   outer row probed   ratio
//	           1,000               143.2              212.1     1.5
//	          10,000                61.4              249.0     4.1
//	         100,000                18.3              243.8    13.3
//
// The heap's corresponding table is flat in both columns — 44.8 to 52.4 ns to
// scan a row, 199.8 to 546.3 to probe one, break-even 4.5 to 10.4. The durable
// table is not flat, and the two reasons are worth separating because only one
// of them is real.
//
// The inner-scan column falls with size because it is not a marginal cost at
// small N. A durable execution has a fixed setup — a scanner goroutine, a
// worker pool, channels, a batch ring — and dividing that by a thousand rows
// charges each row a share of something no row caused. By 100,000 rows the
// fixed part has amortized and 18.3 ns is the honest marginal cost of reading
// one inner row: a page-cache hit, an append into the batch buffer, and a share
// of one columnar pass over a Segment. That is roughly 2.5x cheaper per row
// than the heap's gathered extraction, which is not a surprise — the durable
// inner side reads rows densely in scan order and never gathers at scattered
// addresses.
//
// The probe column is flat at about 244 ns and that is the real finding. A
// durable probe is a key-tree walk, a chunk-directory walk, a page admission,
// and a document copy-out, and none of those grow with the collection because
// all three structures are trees. On the heap the probe cost climbs with size
// as the hash structure stops fitting cache; here the page cache absorbs that.
//
// This table alone would suggest the durable break-even is about 13 at the size
// where it is trustworthy — well above the heap's 4.5 to 10.4 — and therefore
// that the shipped ratio of 4 is merely conservative here. That conclusion is
// wrong, and it is wrong in an instructive way: this table's inner-scan column
// is measured through the parallel batched executor, and the scan that actually
// builds a filter is serial. joinFileBloomScanRatio below carries the
// measurement that matters and the constant it forced.
//
// joinMembershipMax needed no such re-derivation. It bounds how much memory a
// collected set may occupy and how many comparisons an outer row may cost, and
// both of those are properties of the set rather than of the storage the set
// was read from.

// joinFileBloomScanRatio is joinBloomScanRatio for a durable inner side: how
// many inner rows the binder will scan, per outer row, to build a semi-join
// reduction filter.
//
// It is a separate constant because the measurement says it has to be, and the
// reason it has to be is structural rather than a matter of degree.
//
// BenchmarkDurableJoinBloomPrefilter (Apple M4 Max, Go 1.26, 20,000 driving
// rows, 50,000 inner rows, ns per outer row) run under the heap's ratio of 4:
//
//	inner selectivity   filter built   unfiltered   filtered   warm    cold
//	               1%            yes        287.9      365.1   1.27x   1.56x
//	              10%            yes        292.7      402.4   1.37x   1.58x
//	              50%             no        325.1      327.5    1.01x  1.00x
//
// Both multipliers are losses. The filter was not merely unhelpful in the 1%
// row: it survived, and it rejected 19,800 of 20,000 probes outright. Rejecting
// 99% of the probes and still finishing 27% slower warm and 56% slower cold is
// the whole finding, and it says the probe being avoided is cheap relative to
// the scan being spent to avoid it.
//
// The expectation going in was the opposite — that a durable backend would
// favour the filter more than the heap does, because a filter rejection
// converts page I/O into a cache-line test. That reasoning is sound about the
// probe and wrong about the scan, and the scan is what dominates. The inner
// scan that builds a filter runs on the binding goroutine alone, because a
// binding has to exist before the driving scan starts. A standalone durable
// query over the same inner collection runs through the parallel batched
// executor and reaches about 18 ns per row; the serial bind scan behind these
// numbers costs roughly 128 ns per row, seven times more, and that difference
// is entirely the worker pool the bind cannot use. The heap has the same serial
// bind, but a heap inner row costs about 45 ns to scan whether or not anything
// is parallel, so the ratio survives there and does not survive here.
//
// Two therefore replaces four, from a break-even of roughly 250 ns per probe
// against roughly 128 ns per serially scanned inner row, which is 1.95. Two is
// the floor of that, chosen the same way joinBloomScanRatio took the floor of
// its own measured range. Under it the 1% and 10% cases above decline the
// filter — 50,000 candidates against 20,000 outer rows exceeds the budget of
// 40,000 — and land back on the unfiltered lookup, which those rows show is the
// faster answer.
//
// What would change this back is making the bind scan parallel. If the inner
// side were collected through the same worker pool the driving scan uses, its
// per-row cost would approach the 18 ns the cost model measures and the
// break-even would move to roughly 14, well above the heap's. That is the
// single measurement to redo before touching this constant, and it is a real
// opportunity rather than a hypothetical: the filter is currently declined in
// exactly the cases where a parallel bind would make it a large win.

// joinFileEffectiveRatio resolves the caller's setting for a durable inner
