// Workspace owns all transient query execution storage. It reaches execution
// as a field of an [Exec], which is where a caller normally retains it; its
// zero value is ready to use. Reusing one Workspace turns a warmed execution
// whose row, posting-frontier, decoded-text, and group high-water marks fit the
// retained capacity into a zero-allocation operation. That contract includes
// posting merges, escaped-string classification, containment indexing, stable
// ordering, aggregation, grouping, and result materialization. Every backend
// uses it, the durable one for its persistent-index planning as well.
//
// A Workspace is single-consumer and not safe for concurrent use. A compiled
// Query remains safe for concurrent use when each goroutine supplies a distinct
// Exec. Storage borrowed by a Result written by [Query.RunInto] is valid only
// until the next execution reusing the same Workspace or Result.
//
// A query with a [Join] clause also runs its inner side out of this Workspace,
// through one nested set of buffers per clause. That is where a join's
// collected key set, its index needles, and its per-row probe scratch live —
// never in the compiled plan, which is shared by every concurrent execution.
//
// Retained capacity is a high-water mark: it grows to the largest execution the
// Workspace has served and is never reduced by a smaller one, which is what
// makes the steady state allocation-free. One unusually large execution
// therefore pins its working set for the Workspace's lifetime. Call [Workspace.Release]
// to give that memory back, the same trade-off [Result.Release] offers.
