// Lowering a parsed SQL statement onto the builder's plan.
//
// # Three-valued logic, and why it is implemented rather than documented away
//
// SQL's comparison against NULL is UNKNOWN: neither true nor false, dropped by
// WHERE, and — the part that bites — not flipped by NOT. This engine is
// two-valued. Its leaves answer false for a null or absent cell, so Not of a
// comparison on a null path answers true, and a row every other SQL database
// drops is kept.
//
// That divergence is not documentable. A driver that silently returns extra
// rows for "WHERE NOT (x = 1)" is worse than one that refuses the query, and it
// is invisible until a null appears in production data. So it is implemented,
// and the implementation needs nothing the engine does not already have.
//
// The insight that makes it cheap is that the engine's leaves are already
// exact for TRUE. "x = 1" answers true on exactly the rows SQL calls TRUE, and
// false on the union of SQL's FALSE and UNKNOWN. What is missing is a way to
// ask for FALSE alone. So lowering carries two functions rather than one:
// lowerTrue(e) builds a predicate true where e is TRUE, and lowerFalse(e) one
// true where e is FALSE. WHERE takes lowerTrue of its root, because WHERE keeps
// the rows a predicate is TRUE on.
//
//	T(x op v)   = x op v                        (already exact)
//	F(x op v)   = NOT (x IS NULL) AND NOT (x op v)
//	T(NOT p)    = F(p)
//	F(NOT p)    = T(p)
//	T(a AND b)  = T(a) AND T(b)     F(a AND b) = F(a) OR  F(b)
//	T(a OR  b)  = T(a) OR  T(b)     F(a OR  b) = F(a) AND F(b)
//
// Those are Kleene's tables written as two boolean functions, and the recursion
// is a proof by structural induction as long as each leaf's pair is right. The
// leaves are enumerated in leafForm below, each with the two facts the pair
// needs: whether the leaf can be UNKNOWN at all, and the predicate that says it
// is not.
//
// The cost lands only where the semantics differ. A positive predicate — the
// overwhelming majority — lowers to exactly what the builder would have built,
// with no added conjunct and no added column: T of a leaf is the leaf. The
// "NOT (x IS NULL)" guard appears only under an odd number of negations and on
// a negated leaf form (NOT IN, NOT BETWEEN), which is precisely where SQL and
// the engine disagreed.

// lower rebuilds and compiles the plan for one binding of args.
//
// It follows the JSON front end's shape exactly — rewind, prepare, build,
// compile, publish — because that shape is what makes a warmed compile refill

// # Why the move is necessary, and exactly when it is sound

// SQL writes every condition in one WHERE, including the ones that narrow a
// joined collection. The engine has no operator for that: a joined column does
// not exist during the filter phase, which runs before the pairs that would
// give it a row to be indexed by, so it refuses a WHERE that reads one and says
// to use the clause's own filter instead. It refuses rather than rewriting
// because the rewrite is sound only sometimes, and a rewrite that is sound only
// sometimes returns wrong rows the rest of the time without erroring.
//
// The rewrite is sound for a top-level conjunct of WHERE that names one joined
// collection and nothing else. The argument is short. WHERE keeps the pairs
// every top-level conjunct is TRUE on; a conjunct P reading only the joined
// side is TRUE of a pair (d, j) exactly when P(j) holds, so it partitions the
// pairs by their joined document alone. Filtering the joined collection by P
// before the pairing removes exactly the documents j with not-P(j), and so
// removes exactly the pairs the conjunct would have rejected. The two orders
// select the same pairs. Nothing in that depends on P's shape, so a negation,
// a disjunction, or a null test inside P is fine — what matters is only that P
// sits at the top of the conjunction, where "the pairs WHERE keeps" is the
// intersection of what each conjunct keeps.
//
// It is not sound anywhere else, and the two ways out are refused. Under an OR,
// the condition no longer partitions by the joined document: "u.a = 1 OR
// o.b = 2" keeps a pair whose joined document fails the second test, so
// removing that document before the pairing would drop a row SQL keeps. Under a
// NOT that also covers a driving column, the same thing happens through De
// Morgan. Both of those are conjuncts naming two collections, so the single
// check below — a conjunct must name one collection — is the whole rule, and it
// is a check on the conjunct rather than on the shape of what is inside it.
//
