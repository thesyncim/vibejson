// A filePool is an [Exec]'s parked batched-execution goroutines and the
// channels they hand work across: one scanner, one worker per configured
// parallel worker, and the four channels between them. It is built on the first
// batched durable execution and reused by every later one.
//
// It exists for the reason scanPool does, and is built the same way. A batched
// execution used to mint five channels and start its scanner, its workers, and
// a partial-channel closer with `go` on every call. A channel is one or two
// allocations; `go f(a, b)` boxes its arguments into a fresh closure, so a
// goroutine start is one more; and the start itself allocates a whole g
// whenever neither the running processor's free list nor the scheduler's can
// supply one, which happens the more often the shorter the scan, because a fast
// scan cycles goroutines faster than the free lists refill. That scaffolding was
// the entire residual allocation of a warm durable execution — eighteen
// allocations and 2.3 kB that did not move with the corpus at all, being fixed
// per execution rather than per batch or per document.
//
// # Reusing channels means draining them
//
// A channel that outlives the execution that used it is only safe if it is
// empty when that execution ends, and empty for a reason rather than by
// observation: a leftover credit lets the next execution's scanner run further
// ahead of its consumer than the batch ring has slots for, and a leftover
// partial is consumed by the next execution as if it were its own batch. Either
// one returns a wrong answer silently. The argument that they are empty is:
//
//   - credits and jobs are written only by the scanner, once per published
//     batch, in that order and with no intervening branch that could publish one
//     without the other. So after the scan there are exactly out.batches credits
//     taken and out.batches batches queued.
//   - partials is written only by the workers, exactly once per batch they take
//     from jobs. Every queued batch is taken, because every worker keeps taking
//     until it sees the end-of-stream sentinel.
//   - the consumer receives exactly one partial and releases exactly one credit
//     per sequence, and it does not stop until nextSequence has reached
//     out.batches — the count the scanner reports, not a guess. So every partial
//     is received and every credit released.
//   - jobs also carries one sentinel per woken worker at the end, and each
//     worker takes exactly one and parks, so those balance too.
//   - scanDone carries exactly one value and the driver receives it.
//
// That covers the abort paths as well, which is the point of deriving it this
// way rather than from the happy path: an execution that stops early — a
// document that fails to index, a spill that fails to write — stops the scanner
// from publishing *more* batches, and never from balancing the ones it already
// published. Cancellation is a flag rather than a closed channel for exactly
// this reason: a closed channel cannot be reopened, and a cancellation that
// abandoned a queued batch would leave the imbalance this argument rules out.
//
// drained re-checks the conclusion after every execution rather than trusting
// it, because the failure it guards is silent.
