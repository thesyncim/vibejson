// Cross-collection semi-joins.
//
// A join here FILTERS the driving collection; it never widens a row. "Keep the
// orders whose customer is a pro customer" is the whole of it, and a duplicate
// inner match cannot duplicate an outer row because the question a join asks is
// existential. Returning inner columns is a different operator — it changes the
// result's cardinality and its schema, needs an outer/inner null discipline,
// and needs a fan-out plan — so this package rejects a projection inside a join
// clause rather than half-implementing one.
//
// # Why the strategy is measured rather than estimated
//
// Choosing a driving side is the hard part of any join planner, and doing it
// well normally needs cardinality statistics. This engine has none, and the
// consequence of guessing wrong is not a rounding error: a nested-equality
// probe costs 126 ns per document against a DocSet or a durable segment and
// 1.77 ns against a heap Snapshot, a 71x cliff that sits at a path-shape
// boundary an estimator cannot see. A planner that guessed would therefore be
// wrong by two orders of magnitude on exactly the shapes it could not
// distinguish.
//
// So nothing is estimated. The inner side runs first, its join-key values are
// collected, and the collection stops the moment it passes a threshold:
//
//   - Under the threshold the values are pushed into the outer predicate as a
//     membership. That is the existing [In] machinery — a sorted, deduplicated
//     set searched per row, lowering to one mask intersection when the outer
//     path carries a declared exact index — and it is the reason the values are
//     collected at all.
//   - Over the threshold the membership is abandoned unbuilt and the join runs
//     as a lookup: scan the outer, probe the inner once per row. The inner
//     collection is a keyed hash map, so a primary-key probe is O(1) with no
//     build side and nothing materialized; the bounded collection work already
//     spent is the price of learning which side to drive, and it is bounded
//     precisely because the threshold stops it.
//
// The choice changes the cost and never the answer. Both branches evaluate the
// same existential test over the same values, which is what makes forcing the
// threshold to either extreme a real differential rather than a smoke test.
//
// # Why a join must name a database snapshot
//
// Both sides are read from one [store.DatabaseSnapshot]. Resolving the inner
// collection against a separately taken snapshot would let the outer side
// reference a state it never saw — generation 7 of orders joined against
// generation 12 of customers, two states that never coexisted — and no amount
// of care at the call site would make that visible. It is therefore not
// expressible: the inner collection is resolved by name out of the same
// snapshot the driving side came from, and [FromSnapshot] (which names one
// collection and has no catalog behind it) rejects a plan that has a join.

// JoinKey is the inner-path spelling that names the inner collection's primary
// key rather than a field of its documents. It is the common foreign-key
// shape — an outer document holding the key of an inner one — and the only
// shape with an O(1) probe, which is what lets a join over it fall back to a
// lookup instead of materializing a membership.

// decode per outer row whatever the inner side looks like. The membership's is

// 2,048 is the last power of two on the membership's side of the unindexed
// crossing, and comfortably inside the indexed one. Choosing the lower of the

// the membership is 2.4x faster without an index and 48x with one, so giving
// that up early is expensive, while just above it the membership is only about
// 1.01x slower before the threshold cuts it off. Making the threshold

// measured and declined twice, before and after the executor grew its late

// second constant and a branch on a decision that has to be made while the set
// is still being collected.
