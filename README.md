# simdjson

[![ci](https://github.com/thesyncim/simdjson/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thesyncim/simdjson/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Strict JSON processing for Go, written entirely in Go. It provides
`encoding/json`-style `Marshal` and `Unmarshal` for supported values, reusable
typed plans, structural indexing, and optional Go-native SIMD.
The root module has no third-party module dependencies, assembly, C,
`go:linkname`, or private runtime-layout assumptions.

This project is pre-v1: APIs may change while the accepted
[v1 boundary](docs/adr/0001-v1-api.md) is implemented. It is an independent Go
implementation, not the C++ [`simdjson`](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)
project. Algorithm and corpus relationships are recorded in
[the provenance inventory](docs/provenance.md).

## Install

Go 1.26 builds the supported portable backend:

```sh
go get github.com/thesyncim/simdjson@latest
```

The optional SIMD backend requires the exact Go 1.27 development compiler
pinned by the repository:

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap-gotip.sh "$HOME/sdk/simdjson-gotip"
GOEXPERIMENT=simd "$HOME/sdk/simdjson-gotip/bin/go" test ./...
```

`GOEXPERIMENT=simd` enables compiler support; CPU selection and supported
compiler windows are documented in the [toolchain policy](docs/toolchain.md).

## Typed decode

```go
package main

import "github.com/thesyncim/simdjson"

type Event struct {
	ID   int      `json:"id"`
	Name string   `json:"name"`
	Tags []string `json:"tags"`
}

func decode(data []byte) (Event, error) {
	var event Event
	err := simdjson.Unmarshal(data, &event)
	return event, err
}
```

## Typed encode

```go
var eventEncoder simdjson.Encoder[Event]

func init() {
	var err error
	eventEncoder, err = simdjson.CompileEncoder[Event](simdjson.EncoderOptions{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

func encode(event *Event) ([]byte, error) {
	buf := make([]byte, 0, 4096)
	return eventEncoder.AppendJSON(buf, event)
}
```

`AppendJSON` reuses caller-owned capacity. `Marshal` is the allocating
convenience for occasional calls.

## Choose an API

| Need | Start with |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary typed JSON or strict validation | `Marshal`, `Unmarshal`, `Valid`, `Validate` |
| Repeated typed work and buffer reuse | `CompileEncoder`, `CompileDecoder` |
| Framed JSON input or token output | `Reader`, `Writer` |
| Compact, indented, or canonical output | `Compact`, `Indent`, `Canonicalize` |
| Borrowed selection or repeated document navigation | `RawValue`, `Index`/`Node`, or `Parse`/`Value` |

The advanced document APIs are moving into `document` during the pre-v1
migration. JSON kind values already use `document.Kind`; the remaining package
boundary and compatibility decisions are documented in the
[API ADR](docs/adr/0001-v1-api.md).

## Streaming input limits

`NewReader` and a zero `ReaderOptions.MaxValueBytes` leave each top-level value
unbounded. Set a positive protocol limit for untrusted input; the exact stream,
depth, index, and retention limits are in the
[resource contract](docs/contracts/limits.md).

## Ownership and concurrency

Default typed decoding and default `Parse` own the string storage they expose.
`ZeroCopy`, `RawValue`, `Index`, Index-derived `Node`, and reader cursors borrow
storage: keep the source alive and unmodified, and observe each API's
invalidation rule. `Index` and its nodes also borrow caller-provided entry
storage; a node obtained from an owning `Value` keeps that value's backing
arrays alive itself.

Compiled encoders, decoders, and pointers are immutable and safe for concurrent
use. Destinations and source buffers remain caller-owned; each `Reader` or
`Writer` belongs to one goroutine. The complete rules are in the
[architecture and safety record](docs/architecture.md).

## Performance

Performance changes must preserve correctness, ownership, retained memory,
`B/op`, and `allocs/op`. Native CI exercises matched portable and SIMD behavior
on amd64 and ARM64.

[`benchmarks/results/latest.json`](benchmarks/results/latest.json) is the latest
published machine-specific snapshot, not current-main evidence or a universal
ranking. The [benchmark contract and reproduction commands](benchmarks/README.md)
define the methodology, gates, comparison boundaries, and pinned toolchains.
