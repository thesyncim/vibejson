// Corpus-wide value dictionary: the DocSet storage lever behind DocSet.ValueDict.
//
// Real corpora repeat their values as hard as they repeat their keys: a
// ticketing feed names the same handful of venues, seat categories, and area
// sub-objects across every performance; a social feed repeats the same language
// tags, source strings, and boilerplate across every post. Shape-deduplicated
// tapes (docset_shape.go) stop paying for the repeated *keys* by moving them
// into a compiled shape; the value dictionary stops paying for the repeated
// *values*. A general-purpose compressor removes this byte-wise and pays
// whole-value decompression on every read. The dictionary removes it
// structurally, once, without surrendering random access: it interns each
// distinct value span into the set-wide ValueInterner arena (value_dict.go) and
// records, per document, a compact reference in place of each repeated
// occurrence, from which a compacting store drops the repeated source bytes
// while every value still resolves to a stable arena view in O(1) — no
// decompression.
//
//	doc i: [ ... "PLEYEL_PLEYEL" ... {"areaId":205705999,"blockIds":[]} ... ]
//	doc j: [ ... "PLEYEL_PLEYEL" ... {"areaId":205705999,"blockIds":[]} ... ]
//	dictionary: id7 -> "PLEYEL_PLEYEL"   id9 -> {"areaId":205705999,"blockIds":[]}
//	doc i splices: (off,id7) (off,id9)   doc j splices: (off,id7) (off,id9)
//
// A space lever, and it composes. The dictionary indexes each document's
// classic tape at ingest and never changes its semantics: a document still
// reads through its Index exactly as before, the dictionary being the parallel
// structure a compacting store drops the repeated bytes into. That keeps it
// orthogonal to shape tapes — the shape removes key redundancy and the
// dictionary removes value redundancy over the same documents. When both modes
// are on, a shape-taped document's classic tape is synthesized transiently for
// the ingest walk (never cached, so the shape tape keeps its at-rest space
// win), so the two levers stack rather than trade.
//
// What is interned. A value span is any complete value the tape carries — a
// scalar or a whole container subtree — identified by its raw bytes. Interning
// by raw bytes keeps the value exact: a spliced value reads back byte-identical,
// number spellings included, and a container subtree reinstates verbatim. This
// is the KeyInterner discipline (intern.go) applied to value content, with one
// deliberate difference documented at ValueInterner: values intern by their raw
// span, verbatim, because RawValue.Bytes, NumberText, and every round trip
// return the original bytes and a number's spelling ("1e3" versus "1000") is
// significant. The lever that closes the real-corpus gap is the container span:
// one reference replaces a recurring sub-object's bytes and its whole entry
// subtree, where a scalar reference would replace only bytes comparable in size
// to the reference itself. The walk is therefore greedy and top-down — a
// repeated span is taken whole, its members never separately considered — and
// gates on a length floor so a span too short to out-save its reference stays
// inline.
//
// Sighting economics. Interning a value seen once costs a dictionary entry with
// no saving, so — as the shape cache gates compilation behind a repeat sighting
// — a span is interned only on its second appearance. The first occurrence stays
// inline; every later one is a reference. A corpus whose values never recur
// therefore pays only a hash-set probe per candidate, never a dictionary entry
// it cannot amortize.
//
// Read contract. A dictionary-backed value resolves — through DocSet.DocValue
// for a node handle, DocSet.AppendPointer for a batch column, or the RawValue a
// splice yields — to a view over the interned span in the shared arena, in O(1),
// with no decompression. The invariant that makes a dictionary read identical to
// a source read is ValueInterner's: Value(id) is byte-identical to the span
// interned for id, and stays so for the set's lifetime because the arena never
// moves an interned span. A resolved node carries the source entry's info word
// verbatim (kind and flags), so every scalar accessor — a pure function of the
// bytes and that word — returns exactly what the source-backed node would; the
// bounded-exhaustive differential (docset_valuedict_test.go) checks this against
// classic reads across the whole small-scope domain. A resolved node is a
// whole-value materialization handle, not a navigable subtree: a container's
// members are not entries in the arena, so structural navigation stays on the
// source tape the node came from, which the dictionary never alters.
//
// Everything here is safe Go: the interning walk, the splice records, and the
// arena reads use ordinary slice indexing and the same tape accessors that read
// padding-free document slices, whose word kernels anchor every load inside the
// value's own bytes (number_digits.go), so an interned span needs no trailing
// padding.

// valueDictMinSpan is the default length floor for interning. A splice record
// costs eight bytes in memory (a source offset and a dictionary id) and its
// modeled at-rest reference four (the id alone; the offset is implicit in a
// compacting store's residual stream); a span must exceed that to save once its
// reference is charged, and the tape entries a container span also collapses
// make the effective floor lower still. Sixteen bytes keeps short scalars — the
// numbers whose spelling is no longer than their reference — inline, where they
// cost no dictionary entry and no splice record.
const valueDictMinSpan = 16

// valueDictRefBytes is the modeled at-rest cost of one dictionary reference: the
// four-byte identifier a compacting store keeps where it drops a spliced span.
// It is the reference charge in the DocSetStats space model; the live in-memory
