package sql

// The abstract syntax tree.
//
// Every node is a plain struct with exported fields and no methods that hide
// state, so a lowering pass reads it as data. The tree is deliberately shaped
// after the engine's own vocabulary rather than after SQL's: a predicate is one
// tagged node with an n-ary child list, exactly like query's compiledPredicate,
// because the lowering that consumes this is a rename and a walk rather than a
// translation. Where SQL has a construct the engine has no counterpart for, the
// parser rejects it, so no node here exists to represent one — with the two
// documented exceptions [SelectStmt.Having] and [SelectStmt.Offset], which are
// called out on their fields.
//
// A tree produced by a [Parser] is owned by that Parser and is valid only until
// its next Parse; see the Parser documentation. It never points into the
// statement text, so the source may be reused as soon as Parse returns.

// A SelectStmt is one parsed SELECT statement.
type SelectStmt struct {
	// Columns is the SELECT list in source order.
	Columns []ResultColumn

	// From holds the range variables. From[0] is the FROM collection; each
	// later entry is a JOIN, in source order, and carries its own ON
	// condition. Every [PathExpr] in the statement names one of these by
	// index, so a lowering pass never has to re-resolve a name.

	// Having is the post-aggregation filter, or nil.
	//
	// This is one of two clauses this package accepts that the executor has no
	// counterpart for today: query's plan has no filter between reduction and
	// ordering. It is accepted anyway because it is fully resolvable here —
	// the parser binds every HAVING leaf to a column that is already in the
	// SELECT list or to a GROUP BY key, so a HAVING that survives parsing
	// needs a filter-after-reduce step and nothing else. A lowering pass that
	// cannot yet supply one must reject a non-nil Having explicitly rather
	// than ignore it, because silently dropping a filter returns wrong rows.
	Having *Expr

	// OrderBy holds the sort keys, in priority order.
	OrderBy []OrderTerm

	// Limit is the row cap, or nil. It is a numeric literal or a placeholder.
	Limit *Operand

	// Offset is the number of leading rows to skip, or nil.
	//
	// This is the second clause with no executor counterpart: query's plan
	// carries a limit and no offset. It is accepted because a driver-facing
	// SQL dialect without OFFSET is a surprise, and because skipping n rows is
	// a property of the same limiting step. The same rule as Having applies —
	// lowering must reject a non-nil Offset rather than ignore it.
