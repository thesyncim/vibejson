package sql

// Path resolution and the semantic checks that keep an accepted statement
// executable.
//
// Everything here runs after the whole statement has been read, for one
// structural reason: the SELECT list is written before FROM, and a JOIN may
// declare a range variable later still, so no path can be bound to a source at
// the point it is parsed. Deferring all of them to one pass means a path in
// SELECT is resolved by exactly the same rule as a path in HAVING, rather than
// by whatever happened to be known when it was read.

// resolvePaths binds every parsed path to a range variable.
//
// The rule is stated once here and in the package documentation, because it is
// the one place this dialect makes a decision SQL does not have to: SQL knows
// its tables' columns, so `u.address` is unambiguous, while a schemaless
// document may itself contain a field called `u`. The rule is purely syntactic
// and needs no schema:
//
//   - A leading identifier immediately followed by '.' is a range variable if
//     the statement declares one by that name; the rest of the chain is then
//     the path into that source's documents.
//   - Otherwise the whole chain, leading identifier included, is a path into
//     the statement's only source. A statement with more than one source has
//     no "only source", so an unqualified path there is rejected rather than
//     guessed at.
//
// The rule gives range variables priority over top-level fields of the same
// name, which is the only choice that keeps `u.city` meaning what a join author
// expects. The field a range variable shadows is still addressable, and by the
// same rule: qualify it. In a source aliased `u`, the field `u` is `u.u`, and
// its member `city` is `u.u.city`. Nothing becomes unreachable, so the priority
// costs a longer spelling in a rare case rather than expressiveness.
