// The data-definition half of the abstract syntax tree: CREATE TABLE and
// CREATE INDEX.
//
// # The type vocabulary is JSON's
//
// SQL's type system is a tower of widths and precisions — INT, BIGINT,
// SMALLINT, NUMERIC(10,2), VARCHAR(255) — and none of those distinctions exists
// underneath this engine. A stored number is compared by exact decimal value
// (query/scalar.go), deliberately, so that 9007199254740992 and
// 9007199254740993 stay distinct and nothing routes through float64 on its way
// to a comparison. Declaring one column INT and another BIGINT would therefore
// declare a difference the storage, the index, the comparison, and the
// aggregate all refuse to make.
//
// So the vocabulary is the JSON scalar domain the engine has:
//
//	NULL  BOOL  NUMBER  INTEGER  STRING  OBJECT  ARRAY
//
// INTEGER is in the list because the store's own schema has it — it is the
// subset of NUMBER written without a fraction or an exponent — and leaving it
// out would make a real constraint unreachable from SQL.
//
// # Aliases, and the one place an alias would have been a lie
//
// The common SQL spellings are accepted as aliases, because a user pasting a
// schema from elsewhere should get a working table rather than a syntax error
// on a word that has an obvious meaning here: TEXT, VARCHAR, CHAR, and NVARCHAR
// are STRING; INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, and SERIAL are INTEGER; FLOAT,
// REAL, DOUBLE, DECIMAL, and NUMERIC are NUMBER; BOOLEAN is BOOL; JSON and
// JSONB are ANY.
//
// A parenthesised precision is refused rather than accepted and ignored.
// VARCHAR(255) means something everywhere it is written, and a dialect that
// took the word and dropped the 255 would be storing a promise it does not
// keep — the first 256-byte string would prove it. Refusing costs the paster
// one edit and tells them exactly what was dropped; accepting costs them a
// constraint they believe they have.
//
// The types with no mapping at all are refused by name: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP,
// UUID, BYTEA, BLOB, and the rest. JSON has no date and no byte string, so
// there is nothing for them to become that would not be a second convention
// invented here and enforced nowhere.

// A JSONType is a set of JSON types one column may hold. The values are a bit
// set so a column may accept several — which is how NULL is spelled: a column
// that may be absent or null is its type OR'd with TypeNull.
//
// The bits are declared here rather than reused from the store's SchemaType
// because a parser that depended on another package's constant values would be
// depending on them numerically; the lowering maps them across explicitly, one
// case per bit, so a renumbering on either side is a compile error rather than
// a silently permuted schema.

// A CreateTableStmt is one parsed CREATE TABLE.
//
// A table is a collection. A CREATE TABLE with no column list makes a
// collection with no schema, which is the schemaless default and the shape most
// documents want; a column list makes one whose stored documents are validated
// against it on every write, by the schema the store already has.
//
// # What PRIMARY KEY does today
//
// The declaration is parsed and validated in full, and it is lowered to exactly
// what the engine can enforce today, which is less than the declaration
// promises. Stating the gap precisely matters more than closing it here,
// because closing it changes Put's signature and is deliberately sequenced
// after the query work whose oracles depend on the current one.
//
// Enforced today: every path named by PRIMARY KEY becomes a required,
// scalar-typed field of the collection's schema, so a document that omits it,
// or holds a container there, is rejected at write time with the schema's own
// error.
//
// Not enforced today: derivation. The agreed model is that a declared primary
// key is one or more paths into the document and the store key is derived from
// them — never passed separately, never stored twice — with a composite
// encoded by internal/orderedkey. The engine has no such derivation yet, so
// INSERT still supplies the key explicitly, and nothing checks that the key a
// caller supplies agrees with the values at the declared paths. Uniqueness is
// therefore the store's own uniqueness over the supplied key, not over the
// declared paths.
//
// Nothing here fakes the missing half. When the derivation lands, PrimaryKey
// becomes the input to it and this comment loses its second paragraph.
