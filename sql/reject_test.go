// The rejection contract.
//
// These matter as much as the acceptance tests and are checked as strictly. A
// parser that accepts a construct the engine cannot execute has only moved the
// failure to a place with less information: lowering has no statement text, so
// its error cannot point at a byte, and by then the author has been told their
// SQL was fine. Every case here therefore asserts three things — that the
// statement is refused, that the refusal names a position, and that the message
// says something the author can act on.

// rejection is one refused statement. pos is the byte offset the error must
// name; -1 skips the check for the few cases whose position is an
// implementation detail rather than a contract.
