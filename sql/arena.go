// The parse arena.
//
// This is query/compiler.go's chunkArena, applied to the same problem one layer
// earlier. It is duplicated rather than shared because it is unexported there
// and because exporting an allocator from query purely to let the parser borrow
// it would make an internal storage strategy part of that package's API. The
// invariant it exists to hold is identical and worth restating: an AST is a
// graph of interior pointers — a *PathExpr inside a ResultColumn, a []*Expr
// inside an Expr, a string viewing interned bytes — and an append-grown backing
// array moves out from under every one of them when it reallocates, leaving a
// tree whose nodes alias storage the parser has since handed to someone else. A
// chunk is never resized once allocated, so growth only appends a chunk and
// every pointer already issued stays valid until the arena is rewound.
//
// Unlike query's Compiler this has no one-shot "allocate each object exactly"
// mode. There, the one-shot path is a package-level front end whose plan
// outlives the compiler, so the tail of every partly filled chunk is waste that
// is never recovered. Here the one-shot [Parse] is a convenience wrapper whose
// arena dies with the statement, and interning identifiers one heap allocation
// at a time would be strictly worse than filling a chunk. One strategy is
// therefore enough, and one strategy is one thing to get right.

// defaultFirstChunk is the element count of an arena's first chunk when its
// owner did not size it. Later chunks double, so the chunk count stays
// logarithmic in statement size and allocDirty's linear scan over chunks stays
// trivial.
//
// The count is per element rather than derived from a byte budget through
// unsafe.Sizeof, which is how query's arenas size themselves. This package has
// six arenas over known element types, so its owner can simply say how many of
// each a statement needs (see newParser); reaching for unsafe to recompute what
// the author already knows would add an entry to the repository's audited
// unsafe inventory to save six numbers.
