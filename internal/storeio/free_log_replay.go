// of how long the store has been running.

	// FreeLogMaxChainPages is the delta-chain length at which the writer folds
	// the chain back into a fresh image. It is a straight trade: every open
	// reads the whole chain, and every fold rewrites the whole image. At 32 the
	// worst reopen reads 32 delta pages plus at most 16 image pages, 192 KiB at
	// the 4 KiB page size, while a fold recurs at most once per 32 commits and
	// so amortises to well under one image page written per commit. Lowering it
	// makes opens cheaper and steady-state commits more expensive; raising it
	// does the reverse.
	FreeLogMaxChainPages = 32
	// FreeLogMaxFoldSegments is the single-document baseline for how many image
	// segments one fold rewrites, and so how many fold pages an ordinary commit
	// reserves. A durable writer that admits wider atomic batches may raise its
	// in-memory fold limit and transaction reservation up to the complete
	// segment-index capacity; the on-disk format does not encode this policy.
	//
	// It replaced FreeLogMaxImagePages, which bounded the image itself at
	// sixteen pages and therefore bounded the entire free set at about 2,700
	// extents. Bounding the whole image was the only way to bound a fold while
	// the image was a linked list, because changing one page changed the
	// reference in the page before it and a fold rewrote everything. With the
	// segment index a fold rewrites only the segments whose extents changed, so
	// the bound moved off the image and onto the fold, which is where it belongs:
	// the free set may now be as large as the index can name, and it is the
	// per-commit write that stays fixed.
	//
	// Sixteen is chosen against the reclaim batch. Reclamation is what scatters
	// changes across segments, so the store caps one commit's batch by how many
	// segments it would dirty rather than by extents alone, and extents that do
	// not fit stay pending and are offered again next commit. Allocation cannot
	// scatter: it takes from the tail of the lowest-offset extent that fits, so a
	// transaction's page allocations land in a short run of consecutive extents
	// and therefore in one or two segments. Sixteen leaves room for both plus the
	// splits a grown segment causes.

// changed and must carry the rest forward by reference: a fold that rebuilt the
// index from scratch would have to rewrite every segment to learn where it was,
// which is the whole-image rewrite this design removed.

// Resident marks, per segment, whether its extents were read. An open reads
// only the segments it must — the ones the delta chain has records for, which
// cannot be applied otherwise, and then the largest-free ones until the budget
// is spent — because reading all of them makes open time proportional to the
// free set rather than to the part of it the store is about to use. A
// non-resident segment contributes nothing to the returned extents; its page
// remains the whole truth about its own offset range.

// ReplayFreeLog rebuilds the durable free set from head, the newest delta page.
// It walks Prev to the end of the chain, takes the segment index the newest
// page names, reads the segments it needs, and applies the collected deltas
// oldest-to-newest.
//
// segmentBudget caps how many segments are read. It is what keeps an open
// proportional to the working set instead of to the free set: at 165 extents per
// segment, a store with ninety thousand free extents has five hundred and
// forty-six of them, and reading all of them costs half a megabyte before the
// first write. The store does not need them — it needs somewhere to allocate
// from, and the index publishes each segment's largest free extent so the
// biggest can be picked without reading any.
//
// Two classes are read regardless of the budget. A segment the delta chain has
// records for must be read, because a record supersedes what its segment says
// and applying one to nothing would invent an extent. And the budget is a floor
// of one, so a store always has somewhere to look.
//
// dst is appended to and must have room for limit extents; exceeding limit is
// reported rather than grown, because the caller's arena is fixed and reusing a
// larger Go-heap copy would silently move the free set onto the heap.
