// LockWriter acquires the process and operating-system exclusive writer lease
// for file. The in-process file-identity registry closes a hole in advisory
// locks: reacquiring through the same or a duplicated descriptor may otherwise
// succeed and let two durable Store values mutate one generation stream.
//
// Identity, not descriptor number, is what makes an entry a conflict. Both the
// duplicate-descriptor and the reopened-file cases are the same file, so
// os.SameFile decides them, and it is the only test that can: a descriptor
// number is unique only while its descriptor is open, and the kernel hands the
// lowest free number to the next open. An owner that never unlocked — a Store
// dropped without Close, or a test that failed before its cleanup — leaves an
// entry behind whose descriptor the process then reuses for an unrelated file,
// and matching on the number alone refused that file forever after. In this
// repository's own suite one test failing before Close made every later durable
// test in the package fail with "already has a writer: descriptor 4", turning a
// single timing-sensitive failure into forty unattributable ones.
//
// A stale entry is therefore dropped rather than honoured. The registry keeps a
// weak identity for the exact owning os.File and verifies that a reachable owner
// still names the identity captured at lock time. The weak reference neither
// prevents the file finalizer nor confuses a later object at a reused address,
// while remaining correct if the operating system rapidly reuses both the
// closed descriptor number and the unlinked file's inode.
