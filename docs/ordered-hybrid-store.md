# Ordered hybrid store

This is the promotion specification for the next durable primary and exact
index format. It is intentionally stricter than a design sketch: every number
is labeled as measured, projected, or a gate, and no isolated primitive becomes
the default until the complete store passes the gates at the end.

The target is not an LSM. Readers consult one immutable published generation,
with no memtable, delta, tombstone, version-chain, or merge cursor. Mutations
construct the next canonical pages directly and publish one root. Snapshots pin
old immutable roots; qualified in-place materialization is an optimization, and
copy-on-write is always the safe fallback.

## Why the primary cannot be globally hash-partitioned

Arbitrary hash partitioning and global lexical ranges cannot coexist without a
second ordered copy of every key or a sort at query time. Either choice violates
the read-amplification and space goals.

The winning interpretation of hash routing is therefore:

1. route by shortest distinguishing key prefixes to a lexical tablet and leaf;
2. use bounded hash candidates inside that leaf;
3. confirm every candidate against the complete key;
4. store key/value bytes physically in lexical-rank order.

This follows the useful division in Wormhole-style indexes: prefix hashing
keeps point routing independent of total key count, while ordered leaves retain
exact lower bounds and range scans. Swiss-table control groups are useful
inside a leaf, not as the global ordering structure.

## Canonical generation

```text
StateRoot
  |
  +-- TabletCatalog
  |     global lexical fences -> TabletID -> TabletRoot
  |
  +-- TabletRoot
  |     LocalLeafID -> stable (anchor page, row slot)
  |     lexical anchor-page fences -> current AnchorPageRef
  |
  +-- AnchorPage
  |     lexical leaf fences + stable row slots
  |     -> (BucketID, current PageRef, zone)
  |
  +-- OrderedHashLeaf
  |     stable hash slots -> lexical ranks -> exact keys/values
  |
  +-- ExactTermIndex
        exact term -> adaptive (BucketID, quadrant, mask) posting tiles
```

`BucketID` is hierarchical:

```text
BucketID = (18-bit TabletID << 12) | 12-bit LocalLeafID
```

The 30-bit namespace still addresses 1,073,741,824 leaves. A tablet's exact
8 KiB dense locator resolves one stable local ID to an anchor-page ID and row
slot; the anchor row stores the current compact leaf reference once. Primary
point reads route lexically to that row, while posting-driven reads decode
TabletID and LocalLeafID and resolve the same row. This unifies the ordered and
identity routes without a global `BucketMap`, its extra page walk, or a second
copy of every leaf mapping.

One state root selects the tablet catalog, tablet roots, anchor pages, primary
leaves, and exact-index roots. A snapshot therefore chooses the entire database
view in O(1), and all readers see either the old generation or the new
generation.

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. Readers consult exactly one published primary representation.
2. Point reads never consult a range cursor; scans never merge representations.
3. Global iteration, lower bounds, upper bounds, and prefix scans use bytewise
   lexical key order.
4. Hash tags only remove candidates. A hit always compares the complete key in
   the selected leaf.
5. `(BucketID, slot)` is stable across ordinary update and delete and is the
   secondary-posting identity.
6. Slot movement happens only during one bounded split, merge, or slot-class
   rewrite that atomically rebuilds all affected posting tiles.
7. Delete leaves no tombstone, probe-chain obligation, or later compaction work.
8. An active snapshot forces copy-on-write for any bytes it can still observe.
9. Every persistent router, leaf, posting, and allocator structure is
   pointer-free, checksummed, self-describing, and capacity-bounded.
10. False tag matches never scan another leaf, tablet, or table.

## Ordered hash leaf

The ordered-hash leaf candidate now combines the point and lexical paths:

- 256 stable slots for the normal class;
- one control byte per slot: keyed tag plus empty/live state;
- one byte per slot mapping slot to lexical rank, with `0xff` empty;
- compact common key lengths with a rare wide escape;
- a measured decision on restart-interval key-prefix truncation: keys sit in
  the heap in lexical-rank order, so sst-style prefix elision against bounded
  restart points is available without a sort. It must be gated on the local
  hit/miss/iteration budgets because it trades O(1) slot-key access for a
  bounded restart decode; whole-file key bytes on realistic keys are the
  prize (LSM tables already take this trade and win space with it);
- one overflow bit per live rank;
- succinct monotone record boundaries;
- key/value heap in lexical-rank order;
- small bounded insertion stash; no tombstones;
- adaptive 4–64 KiB page classes.

Measured on an M4 Max at commit `a11794f`:

| Isolated leaf operation | Result | Allocation |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| keyed hash, 8-byte key | 12.1 ns | 0 |
| hit, hash included | 30.0–31.1 ns | 0 |
| miss, hash included | 49.3–50.9 ns | 0 |
| stable-slot exact hint | 13.4 ns | 0 |
| three false-tag exact confirmations | 60.3–60.7 ns | 0 |
| lexical iteration | 5.14–5.17 ns/document | 0 |

The measured structural envelope includes controls, slot-to-rank bytes, packed
key lengths, overflow state, Elias-Fano record boundaries and checkpoints, the
40-byte header, and the 16-byte segmented checksum trailer:

| Live rows | Occupancy | Structural B/live key | 8-byte key + 8-byte value physical B/live key |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 218 | 85.2% | 4.954 | 37.58 |
| 225 | 87.9% | 4.876 | 36.41 |
| 230 | 89.8% | 4.996 | 35.62 |
| 244 | 95.3% | 4.848 | 33.57 |

The structural target is met in the intended occupancy band, but the final
column exposes a remaining discontinuity: these small records need roughly
4.8 KiB and therefore occupy an 8 KiB extent under the portable 4 KiB
allocation quantum. The whole-file space target is not met by calling that
padding "free."

The adaptive-capacity experiment finds a better aligned narrow class for the
common 8-byte key plus 8-byte value shape:

| Leaf class | Live rows | Structural B/key | Slack B/key | Physical B/key |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| narrow: 217 slots, 192 normal + 25 stash | 195 | 4.887 | **0.118** | **21.005** |
| fixed 256-slot candidate | 218 | 4.954 | 16.62 | 37.58 |
| byte-packed cold 256-slot leaf | 218 | 4.954 | 0.122 | 21.08 |

The narrow class fits its exact 4,073-byte image in one aligned 4 KiB extent.
In the equivalent isolated loop its average hit is about 52.2 ns versus
52.4 ns for the fixed candidate, its miss is 14.3 ns versus 16.3 ns, and its
lexical scan is about 3.1 ns/document. Exact-key delete and restore reclaims the
same stable slot with no posting change.

Random replacement with unrelated new keys eventually fills the narrow stable
stash, so this is not yet a universal default. The safe upward reclass keeps
the same 192 normal slots and expands only the stash from slots 192–216 to
192–255 in an 8 KiB image. Every existing slot and posting bit survives; the
writer changes one canonical leaf image and its unified anchor handle. One
million simulated random replacements at 195 live rows did not exhaust the
wide class. Its current high-stash hit path is still too slow
(roughly 96–127 ns), so the wide codec needs a bounded hashed stash lookup
before promotion.

Byte-packed immutable runs remain a space-tier experiment for shapes that do
not fit an aligned class well. They use one direct 18-byte hot/cold handle:
48-bit eight-byte-granular offset, 48-bit generation, exact 16-bit length, and
four zone bytes. Readers still select one authoritative leaf, but cold random
misses can cross more device windows: the measured 4,568-byte leaf reads
1.052x the aligned 8 KiB window on average, and an arbitrary packed 4 KiB class
reads 2x. Packed runs therefore are not the default until device-backed random
misses pass the no-regression gate. Overflow references, allocator state,
roots, and value bytes also remain visible in the whole-file benchmark.

Same-length COW update cost scales with admitted extent size:

| Extent | COW | Owned, no observable snapshot |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 KiB | 0.458 µs | 0.395 µs |
| 8 KiB | 0.886 µs | 0.780 µs |
| 16 KiB | 1.802 µs | 1.620 µs |
| 32 KiB | 3.608 µs | 3.001 µs |
| 64 KiB | 7.497 µs | 6.214 µs |

Owned same-length replacement copies only the value bytes, but the current
portable checksum scheme still hashes the intersected half-extent. Insert and
delete remain bounded O(leaf payload), and an owned growth that crosses an
extent boundary fails without mutation so the writer can use the canonical COW
resize path.

At 100 billion documents and 187–230 rows per leaf, the store has roughly
435–535 million primary leaves. With tablets cycling between roughly 2,048 and
4,096 leaves, an average of 3,072 produces about 142,000–174,000 tablets,
within the 262,144-tablet namespace. No Go object may exist per key or leaf;
resident navigation must use packed arrays and bounded page-cache frames.

The current monolithic router prototype proves the codec, not the production
write geometry:

| Isolated M4 Max route | 18/12 result |
| --- | ---: |
| combined routing bytes | 30.10 B/leaf |
| routing bytes at 187 rows | 0.1610 B/document |
| key route, hash included | 185.8 ns |
| key route, hash reused | 136.6 ns |
| resident posting-driven `BucketID` resolve | 25.1–26.4 ns |
| allocations | 0 |

The monolithic image is rejected for ordinary updates because it would rewrite
roughly 100 KiB to change one leaf reference. Production segmentation uses a
4 KiB tablet root, roughly 8 KiB anchor pages, stable anchor row slots, and the
8 KiB local-ID locator. An ordinary value COW then rewrites one anchor page and
its tablet root; the local-ID locator changes only during an anchor structural
rewrite.

### Point read

```text
snapshot root
 -> global tablet route with exact fence confirmation
 -> tablet root and lexical anchor page
 -> compact current leaf reference
 -> ordered-hash leaf, reusing the router's key hash
 -> two bounded control groups plus optional stash
 -> slot-to-rank
 -> boundary select
 -> exact key compare
 -> inline bytes or bounded overflow extents
```

An inline point read must stay within the complete 300 ns gate after tablet
catalog, tablet root, anchor page, and leaf-cache acquisition are included. An
overflow value adds the explicit extent reads reported by the benchmark.

### Ordered scan

```text
TabletCatalog lower bound
 -> snapshot-owned tablet/anchor cursor
 -> current leaf reference from each anchor row
 -> sequential lexical-rank decoder
 -> physically lexical key/value heap
```

There is no sort, tombstone subtraction, hash permutation, or version merge.
Physical sibling `PageRef`s cannot be the authoritative successor because COW
makes them stale in older generations; successor state comes from the
snapshot-owned rooted cursor.

## Updates, deletes, and structural work

Ordinary updates preserve `(BucketID, slot)`, rewrite one leaf plus one
segmented anchor path, and publish one root. The dense LocalLeafID locator is
unchanged because the anchor page and row slot are stable. A same-length,
projection-neutral update may use recovery-journaled canonical materialization
only when no snapshot can observe the old bytes. Otherwise it uses COW.

That per-mutation anchor-path rewrite is the synchronous and async-visible
contract. Buffered-visible mode uses the canonical-frame model from
[hybrid-mutations.md](hybrid-mutations.md), and the two documents share one
definition: an acknowledgement edits only the owned canonical leaf frame in
place (readerExclusive) and marks it dirty; anchor pages, tablet roots,
catalog nodes, and the state root are materialized once per checkpoint by the
bottom-up dirty-frame walk, not once per mutation. Repeated updates to one
leaf coalesce into its single after-image. This is the mechanism behind the
0.45 µs acknowledgement gate: route (~0.19 µs measured) plus one bounded
in-frame edit, with parent amplification amortized across the checkpoint
window. A snapshot or sealed checkpoint that can observe the frame forces the
ordinary COW path; the crash contract is unchanged because buffered
acknowledgements were never durable before their checkpoint.

Delete clears the live control byte and compacts lexical bytes immediately.
It writes no tombstone and leaves no probe-chain obligation. Empty leaves are
removed in the same generation.

Runtime inserts use empty candidate slots and then the bounded stash without
relocating published rows. Bulk build may use augmenting placement because no
posting identity exists yet.

Splits and merges are bounded structural transactions:

- a split keeps the old `BucketID` for the left leaf and allocates one for the
  right;
- rows moved right receive new posting tile identities in the same generation;
- adaptive slot classes avoid half-empty 256-slot leaves after ordinary splits;
- merge hysteresis prevents oscillation;
- every affected exact-index tile is rebuilt atomically;
- p50, p95, and p99 structural latency is reported separately.

The tradeoff is real: many secondary indexes make a slot-class rewrite more
expensive. Hiding that work behind an overlay would only move the cost to every
read and is not permitted.

A macro-tablet split is a larger, explicitly bounded workflow. The half that
keeps the old TabletID preserves its BucketIDs. The moved half receives the new
TabletID, so every affected posting tile must be repaired in the same
generation. Bulk build assigns final tablets bottom-up and pays none of this
rewrite. Runtime split latency, recovery capsule size, and multi-index
amplification are promotion gates; rarity is not permission to omit them.

## Exact indexes and deduplication

One canonical term leaf groups exact ordered scalar tuples. Posting identity is:

```text
TileID = (BucketID << 2) | quadrant
posting = (TileID, uint64 live-slot mask)
```

Four quadrants cover a normal 256-slot primary leaf. Singleton, few-mask, run,
sparse, and dense encodings are selected per posting. Repeated payloads share
leaf-local content-addressed bytes only when the dictionary entry is smaller
than the repeated payloads.

Index definitions are canonicalized by ordered paths and semantics. Aliases
with identical definitions share one physical index root; they do not build or
maintain duplicate postings.

The adaptive exact-term leaf at commit `649c7a3` removes repeated tile, row, and
mask structure without a read regression:

| Posting shape | B/posting, previous candidate → now | Exact lookup, previous candidate → now | Ordered iteration, previous candidate → now |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| low-cardinality singleton | 5.094 → **1.156** | 231.5 → **25.4 ns** | 335 → **1.64 ns/posting** |
| low-cardinality one-mask | 13.09 → **1.266** | 271.6 → **25.9 ns** | 374 → **1.62 ns/posting** |
| high-cardinality singleton | 25.32 → **21.60** | 40.7 → **5.7 ns** | 3,262 → **1.63 ns/posting** |
| high-cardinality one-mask | 33.32 → **21.68** | 41.1 → **5.7 ns** | 3,328 → **1.67 ns/posting** |

All measured paths allocate zero. These are repeated physical-shape fixtures,
not a claim that every adaptive posting distribution compresses to the same
size. On the same four shapes, the new exact lookups are also 28–43% faster
than the equivalent packed-plus-exact baseline. Generic mixed distributions
and complete query execution remain promotion gates.

Posting order is stable identity order, not lexical key order. A query that
explicitly requests lexical index results intersects candidates while walking
the ordered primary cursor or sorts its bounded result. The API must state
which order it promises.

## Allocator and locality

The free-space index uses a 64-way hierarchical maximum over the exact
offset-ordered free extent array. It preserves lowest-offset first-fit and adds
only 0.130 B/extent at 46,200 extents. The isolated late 64 KiB lookup falls
from about 14 µs to about 30 ns.

Reopen must make every durable clean free extent eventually reusable, not just
the largest resident prefix. Cold extents remain packed and are promoted in
bounded chunks. Allocation, deletion, and rollback update the hierarchy without
allocations.

Allocator policy must also preserve lexical locality after random churn.
Logically ordered leaves scattered across the file keep correct scans but lose
sequential device behavior. Tablet-local extent classes, bounded clustering,
and explicit offline repack are part of the production benchmark, not deferred
cleanup.

## Research decisions

Several modern indexes improve one axis by adding a second reader-visible
representation. They are useful evidence, but that trade is rejected here:

- Bf-Tree separates disk pages from variable-size cached mini-pages and reports
  strong point, scan, and update results. Its mini-pages may buffer recent
  updates, so a lookup must reconcile cached state with the disk page. We adopt
  the useful record/page-size decoupling as adaptive canonical leaf classes,
  but do not publish a mini-page delta above a base leaf.
- BzTree appends updates into unsorted leaf space and periodically consolidates.
  Reads inspect the unsorted region, and scans construct sorted response arrays.
  That is the exact read and maintenance debt this design forbids.
- PACTree's fingerprint and indirection arrays over sorted leaf data support
  the local ordered-hash shape. The next leaf persists the exact bounded route
  needed for cold reads rather than requiring recovery-time reconstruction.
- Current updatable learned indexes are not a default primary for arbitrary
  byte-string keys: published evaluations find that leaf key/position storage
  erodes the space advantage and that traditional indexes remain more robust
  across changing distributions. A learned router may be tested as an optional
  accelerator only after the exact prefix route exists.

Linux hardware atomic writes are a worthwhile capability lane, not a
portability assumption. Linux 6.13 exposes regular-file atomic-write limits
through `statx`; ext4 and XFS can accept aligned `O_DIRECT` `pwritev2` writes
with `RWF_ATOMIC` when the filesystem and device support them. This prevents a
torn target write, but it does not by itself solve the old-root/new-leaf crash
window or active snapshots. A future materialization lane may use it to shrink
the undo capsule from damage-granule images to the exact changed bytes, while
retaining the generation publication protocol and COW fallback. It must be
capability-probed and benchmarked; unsupported filesystems keep identical
semantics.

## Architecture-review closure ledger

The external review targeted commit `bc96a8a`, before the durability,
transaction, format, and retirement fixes now on `main`. Its findings remain
release gates even when the original bug is closed:

| Finding | Current disposition | Required proof before release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unsafe zero-value durability | closed: `DurabilitySync` is zero and SQL path DSNs use it | data/root write and barrier failure matrix |
| failed synchronous commit remains visible | closed: applied, visible, and durable states are distinct; failure rolls readers back or fails closed | concurrent failure/reader tests plus reopen oracle |
| SQL uses statement snapshots and misses staged writes | closed: `BeginTx` retains one leased root and all reads use its overlay | insert/update/delete read-your-writes, repeatability, phantom, conflict, and lease-release tests |
| documented and implemented formats disagree | closed for the current inline-root format and locked by golden images | the vNext cutover updates the same authority and supplies copy migration |
| retired extents require full/quadratic scans | closed in the hot path: generation order, a moving head, bounded drains, and a fixed interval AVL remove pending-set scans | million-extent adversarial ordering, reopen, race, and allocation gates |
| reusable allocation is linear | closed for selection by the fixed 64-way maximum hierarchy | fragmentation, coalescing, locality, and long-churn whole-file gates |
| files are not self-describing | closed: exact canonical definitions, geometry, and admission bounds are durable; zero-option reopen rehydrates them before runtime resources | corrupt/missing/grafted catalog rejection, exact round trip, and current-device reassertion for in-place materialization |
| overlapping mutable engines and representations | open: vNext must become the only public mutable path; compact bulk cannot silently change performance class | API inventory plus deletion of obsolete paths after migration tests |
| compact bulk creates a read cliff | rejected as the default; paired point and all-byte benchmarks are mandatory | no promoted codec may regress point, random, lower-bound, or ordered scan gates |
| one collection is too large a 100 TB ownership unit | in progress: stable tablet/block identities and a shared-runtime-compatible catalog | split/merge, snapshot ownership, bounded resident metadata, and 100-billion-row simulations |
| backup, verify, salvage, and physical space return are missing | open | live-snapshot export, offline verify/salvage, and `vacuum-into` workflows |
| cross-tablet durability and snapshots are unspecified | intentionally after the local vNext format | leader epoch/sequence fencing, retained root history, safe-time reads, and GC watermark model |

Closing a row does not remove its tests. A rewrite that reintroduces one of
these failures is rejected even if its isolated codec benchmark is faster or
smaller.

## Promotion gates

The next format replaces the current primary only when the complete durable
store, not an isolated leaf, passes all gates on equivalent corpora:

| Metric | Gate |
| --- | ---: |
| warm random point | ≤300 ns, 0 alloc |
| lexical iteration | ≤6 ns/doc, 0 alloc |
| ordered all bytes | ≤60 ns/doc |
| local hit including hash | ≤45 ns |
| local miss including hash | ≤55 ns |
| async YCSB-B | ≥2.80 M ops/s |
| async YCSB-A | ≥2.15 M ops/s |
| async YCSB-F | ≥1.56 M ops/s |
| async churn | ≥2.23 M ops/s |
| async ordered-scan mix | ≥0.79 M ops/s |
| update p50 / p99 | ≤0.45 / 1.5 µs |
| delete + restore p50 / p99 | ≤0.75 / 1.8 µs |
| structural metadata | ≤5.0 B/live key after measured churn |
| whole-file disk | ≥15% below the best matched production-compressed competitor |
| sustained-churn live disk | flat live bytes under steady replace/delete while matched LSMs grow between compactions; measured as a first-class harness lane, not inferred |
| snapshot creation | O(1), no per-key work |
| snapshot-held read path | same page count and ≤1% latency change |
| post-delete debris | zero tombstones and version records |

The current async baseline is far below the mutation gates. The current Darwin
power-loss-safe pair also trails SQLite by 11–14% across YCSB-B/A/F, churn, and
the ordered-scan mix. Those are explicit open gaps, not projected wins.

## Integration sequence

1. Prove the ordered-hash leaf with exact differential, corruption, occupancy,
   split, stash, lower-bound, prefix, and scan tests.
2. Prove the persistent prefix `AnchorMap` under pathological shared prefixes,
   absent bounds, collisions, splits, and merges.
3. Add compact leaf envelopes and references; simulate 100-billion-document
   bounds before claiming 5 B/key.
4. Introduce one new root containing the tablet catalog, segmented tablet
   anchors and local-ID locators, primary leaves, and exact-term roots.
5. Integrate read-only point and lexical range paths first. Stop if either read
   gate fails.
6. Bulk-build final leaves and postings bottom-up. Unsorted input may use
   bounded unpublished scratch, never a runtime LSM.
7. Add ordinary update/delete with stable slots and COW publication.
8. Add split/reclass/merge with atomic posting repair and multi-index p99 tests.
9. Add qualified materialization and automatic combining only after crash-cut
   and snapshot proofs.
10. Run current point, scan, mixed, snapshot, overflow, index, memory, and disk
    matrices with matched production compression.
11. Make the winner the sole default and delete obsolete primary paths. The
    repository is unreleased, so there is no permanent two-engine tax.

## Known weaknesses

- Active snapshots force COW and can remove the in-place small-update win.
- A macro-tablet split rewrites moved leaves' secondary posting identities.
- Adaptive slot-class changes do bounded but potentially large multi-index work.
- Large incompressible documents lower occupancy or add overflow reads.
- Holding ≤5 B/key under churn requires measured occupancy and merge hygiene;
  a bulk-build number is insufficient.
- The current compact document codec is too slow to be a blanket default.
- Random churn can destroy physical scan locality without an allocator/repack
  policy.
- Isolated leaf numbers omit router, cache, checksum, durability, and index
  maintenance costs; they are evidence, not database-level victories.
