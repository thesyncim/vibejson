// This file implements bulk stream ingestion: ReadFrom fuses the streaming
// Reader's document framing with the DocSet's arena-resident indexing. Bytes
// are read in large blocks straight into the source arena's spare capacity,
// each document is framed and indexed where it landed, and committing a
// document only extends the arena over storage already written in place — no
// intermediate buffer, no per-document copy, and on the hot path a single
// pass that validates, indexes, and locates the document's end together.
//
// The current source chunk plays both roles at once — committed arena on the
// left, read buffer on the right:
//
//	0             len(srcChunk)    pos              bufEnd            cap
//	|  committed documents  | ws  |  read-ahead      |  unfilled       |
//	                               ^ next document starts here
//
// The committed length only ever grows over bytes already framed and
// indexed, so a failed document needs no rollback: its bytes sit in the
// uncommitted read-ahead and are simply never committed. When a document
// straddles the chunk's end, only its uncommitted prefix is copied into the
// next chunk (fill); committed documents never move.
