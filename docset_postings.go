// The inverted posting layer: existence and containment made sublinear.
//
// A full columnar scan answers "which documents have key K" or "which
// documents contain value V under path P" in one pass over every document —
// linear, and wasteful when the predicate is selective (a handful of the
// corpus matches). This layer builds, opt-in at ingest behind DocSet.Postings,
// two inverted structures that turn those questions into a hash probe plus a
// visit of only the candidates, so a selective WHERE (ADR 0003) prunes instead
// of scans.
//
//	existence   key K --interner--> id --keyShapes--> shapes with K
//	                                     --shapeDocs--> their document ordinals
//	                                     + a scan of the non-conforming remainder
//	containment (path P, value V) --hash--> bucket --value--> candidate ordinals

//
// Key existence reuses shape deduplication (docset_shape.go). A shape-taped
// document's top-level keys are exactly its proven shape's fields — the shape
// was byte-verified against the document at ingest — so "shape S contains key
// K" is decided once per shape, and every document stored under S inherits the
// answer without a per-document look. Inverting the interner's key id to the
// shapes carrying it, and each shape to its document list, resolves existence
// by unioning those lists. Documents whose layout was not proven to a shape —
// the non-conforming remainder, everything stored classic — cannot borrow a
// shape's answer, so they are listed and scanned exactly, which stays cheap
// when the remainder is a small fraction (the shape-clustered corpus the whole
// layer targets). With ShapeTapes off no document is shape-proven and the
// remainder is the whole set, so existence stays correct but unaccelerated;
// the two flags are designed to be enabled together.
//
// Value containment is the inverted-index analogue. Every scalar a
// document carries under a top-level key — the key's own value, or a scalar
// element of a top-level array value — is bucketed by (path hash, canonical
// value hash). A query field @> needle hashes (path, needle) the same way,
// gathers the bucket, and verifies each candidate with Node.Contains, the
// landed containment evaluator (contains.go). The hash is canonical, not
// literal: numbers bucket by their float64 value and strings by decoded
// content, so 1.0 and 1 share a bucket and an escaped spelling matches its
// decoded twin — whatever Node.Contains judges equal must never miss the
// bucket, or a true match would be lost. Collisions only widen the candidate
// set; the verifier removes the false positives, so WhereContains returns the
// exact answer, equal to a full scan.
//
// The posting lists are ordinal slices, never handed out by reference —
// WhereExists and WhereContains return freshly allocated results — so, unlike
// the interner and shape arenas whose interior views are borrowed and must
// never move, these may grow and relocate freely. The key spellings and shape
// records they route through do live in the never-moving interner and shape
// arenas. Everything here is safe Go: slice indexing and map probes bounded by
// the ingest invariant that every indexed ordinal is a live document.

// docPostings holds a DocSet's inverted structures. It is built incrementally
// at ingest (indexPostings) and read by WhereExists and WhereContains. The zero
// value is not ready; DocSet.indexPostings constructs it on the first indexed
