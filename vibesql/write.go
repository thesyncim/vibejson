// The write path: turning a prepared mutation into a set of keyed document
// writes, and applying it.
//
// # Two writers, one of which is atomic
//
// A connection writes to one of two things, and the difference is not
// cosmetic. A durable collection has [durable.Collection.Update], which
// publishes a whole batch as one generation — one document-page rebuild per
// touched chunk, one copy-on-write descent per directory, one state root, one
// fence — under a single writer lock. A heap collection has Put and Delete and
// nothing between them: each is atomic by itself, and a statement touching
// three documents is three publications.
//
// So a statement against a durable collection is failure-atomic and a statement
// against a heap collection is not. That difference is stated everywhere it
// shows — here, in [Conn.BeginTx]'s refusal for a heap source, and in the
// package documentation — rather than smoothed over, because smoothing it over
// would mean offering the same syntax with two different guarantees and naming
// only the stronger one.
//
// What is done about it, rather than merely said: every document a statement
// will write is validated before the first one is written. A heap statement can
// therefore still fail partway on an I/O-shaped error the heap store does not
// have, and cannot fail partway on the error a caller actually produces, which
// is a malformed or schema-violating document.
//
// # Read, then write, inside one lock
//
// A filtered UPDATE or DELETE has to decide which documents match before it can
// write, and the decision has to be made against the state the write applies
// to. For the durable backend both happen inside one Update: the callback takes
// its own snapshot, which loads exactly the state the batch will be applied to,
// because the writer lock Update holds is the lock every other writer needs.
// There is no window between the scan and the write for another writer to move
// a document out from under the statement, so an autocommit statement is
// serializable against every other writer with no conflict detection at all.
//
// An explicit transaction cannot do that — its statements execute when the
// application calls Exec, and the commit happens later — so it takes the other
// road: snapshot isolation with commit-time conflict detection. See tx.go.

// errNoLastInsertId is what LastInsertId answers.
//
// Returning an error rather than zero is the whole point. A document's key is
// an opaque string the caller chose; there is no sequence, no autoincrement,
// and nothing an int64 could stand for. A driver that answered 0 would be
// answering a question it did not understand, and a caller that recorded the
// answer would have recorded a number that means nothing about their data.
