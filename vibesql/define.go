// CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX.
//
// # Which backend accepts which statement, and why the other refuses
//
// Both statements are heap-only today, and both refusals are the engine's
// rather than this package's:
//
// CREATE TABLE creates a collection in a catalog. [store.Database] is a
// catalog and has CreateCollection; a durable collection is one file holding
// one collection with no catalog above it, created by the application that
// chose its options. A durable catalog is being built elsewhere and does not
// exist on this branch, so a CREATE TABLE against a file DSN has nowhere to go
// and is refused by name.
//
// CREATE INDEX adds an index to a live collection. The heap [store.Collection]
// implements store.IndexManager — CreateIndex publishes the definition, every
// later write maintains it, and BackfillIndex processes the documents already
// there. A durable collection's indexes are frozen when the file is created and
// it deliberately does not implement IndexManager; online index creation for it
// is being built elsewhere. So CREATE INDEX against a durable collection is
// refused rather than silently made a no-op, which is the one outcome that
// would leave a caller believing they had an index.
//
// Neither refusal is a design position. Both become one line of dispatch when
// the corresponding engine work lands.

// execDefine runs a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX.
//
// It reports zero rows affected, which is the truth: RowsAffected counts
// documents, a definition writes none, and reporting 1 for "one object created"
// would be counting a different thing under the same name.

		// things.
