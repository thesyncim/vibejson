// Transactions.
//
// # What a transaction is here, exactly
//
// A transaction is one [durable.WriteBatch]: the set of writes one Update
// publishes as one generation. That is the largest atomic unit this engine
// has, and saying so is the whole design. Everything below follows from it.
//
// A transaction therefore:
//
//   - writes exactly one collection. Each durable collection has its own root,
//     its own generation counter, and its own writer lock; there is no operation
//     anywhere in the engine that publishes two collections together. A
//     statement naming a second collection is refused by name rather than
//     written non-atomically.
//   - writes at most Options.MaxBatchDocuments documents (64 by default). The
//     batch is a fixed page reservation, and it is refused whole rather than
//     split, because a batch spanning two commits is not the atomic unit the
//     caller asked for. The limit is checked as statements execute, so the
//     statement that exceeds it is the statement that fails.
//   - requires a durable collection. A heap store.Database has Put and Delete
//     and nothing that publishes several together, so a transaction over one
//     could only be a promise this package could not keep. BeginTx refuses it.
//
// # The isolation guarantee, stated precisely
//
// Against readers: snapshot isolation, and it is the store's, not this
// package's. Begin takes one durable.Snapshot and every SELECT and mutation
// decides against that same generation, overlaid with the transaction's staged
// writes. The snapshot holds a generation lease; the writer's copy-on-write
// publication installs a new state root and cannot reuse the extents that
// lease pins. A concurrent update or insert is therefore invisible for the
// transaction's whole lifetime — repeatable reads and phantom exclusion are
// properties of one retained root, not a best-effort sequence of fresh reads.
// A commit is never partially visible to anyone, because visibility changes
// with a single atomic store of the state pointer.
//
// Against writers: a transaction is snapshot-isolated with first-committer-wins
// conflict detection, which is exactly what its structure can support and no
// more. Its statements execute when the application calls them, against the
// snapshot Begin retained; the writes are held back until Commit. Between the
// two, another writer may publish. So Commit re-reads, under the writer lock,
// every key the transaction wrote, compares it byte for byte against the
// begin-snapshot pre-image, and aborts the whole transaction if any of them
// moved. A transaction that commits therefore wrote from a state that was
// still true when it wrote — which is what a lost update is the absence of.
//
// What that does not give is serializability. Snapshot isolation permits write
// skew and has no predicate conflict detection: a transaction whose WHERE
// matched three begin-snapshot documents continues to see those three, but it
// can commit alongside another that inserted a fourth match because neither
// wrote what the other read. Nothing here claims otherwise, and the alternative
// — holding the collection's writer lock from Begin to Commit — would make an
// application's think time into a global write stall and a forgotten Rollback
// into a deadlock for every other writer in the process.
//
// An autocommit statement is stronger than a transaction of one statement, and
// that is worth knowing rather than surprising. An autocommit statement does
// its whole scan inside the Update callback, under the writer lock, so it is
// serializable against other writers and cannot conflict at all. See write.go.

// ErrConflict reports a transaction that could not commit because a document it
// read was changed by another writer after it read it. Nothing was written; the
// transaction is rolled back and the whole of it may be retried.
