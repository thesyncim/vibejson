// Rows, and the JSON-to-driver.Value mapping.
//
// # How a JSON value becomes a driver.Value
//
// driver.Value is a closed set — nil, bool, int64, float64, []byte, string,
// time.Time — and JSON is not. The mapping below is chosen so that no value is
// silently changed on the way out, which rules out the obvious answer for
// numbers.
//
// A number is int64 when it is an integer int64 can hold, and its exact decimal
// digits as []byte otherwise. It is emphatically not float64. This engine
// compares numbers by exact decimal value on purpose: 9007199254740992 and
// 9007199254740993 are two distinct values here, and both are one float64.
// Routing every number through float64 would make a driver that returns the
// wrong integer for a perfectly ordinary 19-digit identifier, and would do it
// silently. Digits cost a []byte and scan into a float64, a string, a
// json.Number, or a big.Int as the caller chooses; a collapsed float cannot be
// uncollapsed. Non-integer numbers take the same path for the same reason —
// 0.1 is not representable in binary floating point, and the document said 0.1.
//
// A string is []byte rather than string, and the reason is lifetime, not taste.
// A projected string cell borrows either the collection's document bytes or the
// execution workspace's decoded-text buffer, both of which are reused by the
// next execution. Handing that out as a Go string would be handing out a string
// whose bytes change later, which is a contract violation no amount of
// documentation repairs. database/sql copies a []byte on Scan into every
// destination but sql.RawBytes, so []byte is both correct and free: the copy
// happens once, at the boundary where the caller decides to keep the value.
//
// An object or an array has no driver.Value analogue at all, so it is its exact
// JSON bytes. That is lossless, it is what the document held, and it scans
// straight into json.Unmarshal or a []byte. Inventing a wrapper type would make
// it unscannable by anything that did not import this package.
//
// Null is nil, and covers the absent path too, because this engine defines an
// absent path and an explicit null as one value. See the package documentation.

// cells it hands out borrow the collection and the workspace, and database/sql
// copies them at Scan.

// would read an empty string as an absent field.
//
// It is a guard rather than a fix: the engine's string and payload views are
// built with byteview, whose zero-length views keep a real backing pointer and
// so are already non-nil. TestDriverEmptyStringIsNotNull pins the observable
// contract rather than either layer's implementation of it, which is what makes
