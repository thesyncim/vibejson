// Where a connection's rows come from.
//
// The DSN is deliberately not a parameter language. It is one of two things:
//
//	/var/lib/app/users.vj      a durable collection file
//	memory:analytics           a source this process registered with Attach
//
// The file form is the one a caller reaches for first, and it carries a real
// limitation worth stating rather than hiding. A durable collection's options —
// its index catalog above all — are fixed when the file is created, and Open
// refuses a mismatch, so a path alone can only open a collection created with
// default options. A file with declared indexes has to be opened by the
// application that knows its options and handed over with [AttachCollection].
// Inventing a DSN syntax for index definitions would be inventing a second
// spelling for durable.Options, which is the kind of thing that is easy to add
// and impossible to remove.
//
// The memory form is not a convenience. A join is executable only against a
// [store.DatabaseSnapshot], the consistent multi-collection cut, and only a
// heap [store.Database] can produce one; a durable file holds exactly one
// collection and has no catalog. So the shape of the source decides which
// statements a connection can run, and [Attach] is how an application that
// already holds a Database lets SQL read it.

// ErrUnknownSource reports a DSN naming a registered source that does not
// exist.

// filesystem path. It is a scheme rather than a query parameter so that adding
// a second scheme later cannot change how an existing DSN parses.

// A source is the collections one DSN resolves to, shared by every connection
// that names it.
//
// It is shared rather than per-connection because a durable collection takes an
// exclusive writer lock on its file: a second Open of the same path fails, and
// database/sql opens a connection whenever its pool decides to. Reference
// counting is at the connector, which database/sql closes with the DB.
