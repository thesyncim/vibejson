// The database/sql surface: driver, connector, and connection.
//
// # Why one Exec per connection, and why that is the whole concurrency story
//
// database/sql hands a driver.Conn to one goroutine at a time and never lends
// the same one to two, but it will happily run many connections at once. A
// [query.Exec] is single-consumer for the same reason a Result is: it holds the
// column, posting, group, and result buffers whose retained high-water capacity
// is what makes a warmed execution allocation-free, and two goroutines sharing
// one would interleave writes into a single set of them. Those two facts fit
// exactly: one Exec per connection is both safe and the only arrangement that
// keeps the buffers warm, because a per-execution Exec would start cold every
// time.
//
// Nothing else here is shared. A prepared statement's plan lives in a
// [query.Statement] that belongs to one connection, so two goroutines preparing
// the same SQL through one *sql.Stmt get two connections, two statements, two
// compilers, and two plans. The source — the heap database or the durable
// collection — is shared, and is safe for concurrent readers by its own
// contract.
