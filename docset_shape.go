// Shape-deduplicated tapes: the DocSet storage mode behind DocSet.ShapeTapes.
//
// A shape-clustered corpus stores the same ordered key sequence millions of
// times, and the classic tape stores it again per document: a flat object of
// N members costs 2N+1 entries, and N of them are key entries whose spelling
// the ShapeCache has already compiled once for the whole cluster. This mode
// stops paying for them. A conforming document — a flat root object whose
// key sequence byte-matches a compiled shape — keeps only its N value
// entries, in shape ordinal order, plus one compact header naming the shape
// and the root's source span:
//
//	classic  [ obj | key0 | val0 | key1 | val1 | ... ]   (2N+1) x 16 B
//	dedup    [ val0 | val1 | ... ]                        N x 16 B
//	         + shapeTapeRef{shape, root span}             one per document
//
// The keys live once, in the shape record; the per-document tape becomes a
// dense value array. That is both the space win (the tape roughly halves on
// object-heavy corpora) and the speed win: extracting a field from a
// conforming document is one shape-pointer compare and one array index — no
// header proof, no key verification, no suffix scan, and no source-byte
// touch, which on corpora larger than cache is the difference between
// streaming one tape line per document and faulting scattered source lines.
//
// Dual widths: the value array itself comes in two entry widths, chosen per
// document at ingest. The flatness identity the conformance gate already
// proves (root.next == 2*count+1) forces every member value to exactly one
// entry, so a dedup value entry never carries structure: its next is
// provably 1 (the root's span identity holds only if every member subtree is
// one entry, and a one-entry value's next is its subtree size) and its count
// bits are zero (scalars and empty containers alike). Position is ordinal.
// What remains is the span and the kind/flag bits, and for a document whose
// root ends within the first 64 KiB of its source those pack into eight
// bytes — shapeNarrowValue, half the classic width. Documents with a wider
// root span keep 16-byte value entries; the width is recorded per document
// in its header ref, and both widths reconstitute the identical classic
// entry on widening, so the choice is invisible to every read. Narrow
// arrays live in one set-wide slab (DocSet.narrow) rather than the pinned
// entry arena: no caller ever holds a pointer into them — hot paths copy
// eight bytes out, cold paths widen — so the slab may relocate as it grows.
//
// The trust boundary shifts, deliberately, from read time to ingest time.
// The classic shape paths never trust the fingerprint for reads: every
// positional read re-verifies key bytes because a fingerprint collision must
// never misread a field. Dropping key entries makes read-time verification
// impossible, so the proof moves to the single place the key bytes are still
// on hand: shapeTapeCompact byte-compares every key of the freshly built
// tape against the shape's compiled raw spellings before any key entry is
// dropped. A document is stored in dedup form only after that exact match,
// so the stored shape reference is proven, not fingerprint-routed, and read
// paths may index the value array with no residual collision deviation.
// Whatever fails the proof — a first-sighted layout under the cache's
// sighting economics, a non-flat or non-object root, an empty object, a
// fingerprint collision, or a shape with duplicate decoded names (dropping
// keys would erase which member a spelling names; see shapeRecord.dupKeys) —
// is stored classic, unchanged.
//
// Doc(i) keeps its one spelling and full contract in this mode: it always
// returns a fully functional classic Index. For a shape-taped document the
// classic tape no longer exists, so the first access synthesizes it — the
// header from the ref, each key's span recovered by a backward scan from its
// value (exact because ingest proved the spelling), each value copied
// verbatim, enrichment re-applied if the original build had it — and caches
// it for the set's lifetime, so handles stay stable and repeat access is an
// ordinary map hit. The synthesized tape is entry-for-entry identical to
// what classic mode would have stored, which the differential tests pin.
// The costs are documented at Doc: a first access allocates the classic
// tape, and a caller that widens every document has re-bought the storage
// this mode dropped. Engines that want the space win extract through the
// fused batch primitives, which run natively on the value arrays.
//
// Everything here is safe Go: the compaction, the conformance proof, the
// widening scan, and the batch reads use ordinary slice indexing, bounded by
// the ingest invariant that a dedup document's entry count equals its
// shape's field count.

// A shapeTapeRef is the per-document header of a shape-deduplicated tape:
// the proven shape, the root object's source span, the entry width with the
// narrow array's slab position, and whether the original build enriched key
// hashes (so widening reproduces the exact classic tape). The zero ref (nil
// rec) marks a classic document.
