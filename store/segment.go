// A Segment indexes a batch of JSON documents into shared storage. Append
// copies each document into a chunked source arena and builds its index in a
// chunked entry arena, so a batch of N documents costs a handful of arena
// allocations instead of two per document, and consecutive documents' bytes
// and entries stay adjacent for batch scans. ReadFrom ingests an entire
// stream of documents in bulk, reading straight into the arena.
//
// The two arenas follow the interner's never-moving discipline: a chunk is
// appended to only within its capacity and retired in place when full, so
// nothing handed out is ever invalidated.
//
//	source arena   chunk: [ doc0 | doc1 | doc2 |  spare )
//	entry arena    chunk: [ e(0) | e(1) | e(2) |  spare )
//	docs[i] = Index{src, entries}: subslices of the two arenas
//
// Under the opt-in ShapeTapes mode a conforming document's e(i) holds only
// its value entries — the classic tape's keys live once in a compiled shape
// — with a per-document header alongside; segment_shape.go owns that
// representation and its contracts.
//
// Growth within an Append is transactional: the document's bytes land in the
// source chunk's uncommitted tail first, the index builds into the entry
// chunk's tail, and only success extends the committed lengths over both.
// On failure the tails are truncated, which is a length rollback with no
// copying — the uncommitted bytes were never visible.
//
// Doc returns the ordinary Index over a stored document, with the full
// per-document API. Arena chunks are append-only and never moved, so every
// Index, Node, and RawValue obtained from the segment remains valid across later
// Appends. A failed Append leaves the segment unchanged. The zero Segment is empty
// and ready to use. A Segment is not safe for concurrent use; concurrent reads
// are safe once appending stops.
type Segment struct {
	// Options configures indexing, read at each Append. Set HashKeys before
	// the first Append for lookup-heavy engines: enrichment costs one linear
	// pass over the entries at build time and accelerates every Get after it.
	Options document.IndexOptions

	// ShapeTapes opts the segment into shape-deduplicated tapes, read at each
	// Append like Options: a conforming document stores one entry per member
	// value instead of the classic tape, roughly halving tape storage on
	// shape-clustered corpora and letting the batch extractors index value
	// arrays directly. Value entries are themselves dual-width: a document
	// whose root span fits 16-bit offsets (under 64 KiB) stores 8-byte
	// entries, halving the value array again; wider documents keep 16-byte
	// entries. Semantics never change — every lookup, extractor, and Doc
	// result is identical to classic storage — but Doc's cost does: its first
	// call on a shape-taped document materializes and permanently caches the
	// classic tape (see Doc). Set it before the first Append.
	//
	// Conformance decides whether the mode helps, and it is strict, so read it
	// before enabling: a document conforms only if its root is a non-empty
	// object whose every member value is a single tape entry — that is, a
	// scalar or an empty container. One nested object or array anywhere at the
	// root disqualifies the whole document, and its members are not considered
	// separately. The root's key sequence must also byte-match a shape the
	// segment's cache has already compiled, which takes a second sighting of that
	// layout, and the layout must not repeat a decoded key name. Whatever
	// fails is stored classic, unchanged and correct.
	//
	// The consequence is that the option is a lever for flat corpora, not a
	// general one. On a flat corpus it is a large win; on a corpus whose
	// documents all carry a nested value it can store nothing at all, and
	// enabling it there buys a per-document conformance check that always
	// fails. Measure rather than assume: Segment.Stats reports ShapeTaped, so a
	// short ingest tells you which corpus you have. See segment_shape.go for
	// the representation and its proof obligations.

	// rather than scanning every document. Key existence resolves through the
	// shape index, so it is most effective paired with ShapeTapes — with shapes
	// off every document is the non-conforming remainder and existence stays
	// correct but scans; value containment prunes regardless. Set it before the
	// first Append: enabling it later leaves earlier documents unindexed, and
	// the query paths detect the gap and fall back to a full scan. Ingest pays

// batch scan, the per-batch Segment was 411 of every 430 allocations one

// of them after a Reset is a use-after-free that Go's memory safety cannot
// catch: the memory is still mapped and still owned by this segment, so a stale
// Index does not fault — it silently reports a later document's bytes as an
// earlier document's value. This is the same destination-reuse boundary as
// KeyInterner.Reset and the append-style APIs, and it is the whole reason the

// that an Index outlives later Appends, and a caller who has published views to
// anyone else must not call Reset. A caller who detaches what it keeps — copying
