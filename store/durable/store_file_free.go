// The durable free set, and why it is a log rather than a tree.
//
// Reclaimed space is only free once it is written down. The B+tree that used to
// hold it could persist exactly one edit per commit, because mutating a tree
// costs pages, allocating those pages changes the free set, and a changed free
// set changes the tree's shape. Everything a commit reclaimed past the first
// extent stayed in memory and was abandoned at the next restart, clean or not:
// the same write volume cost 6.3 MiB in one session and 23.9 MiB across eight.
//
// A flat log breaks that cycle because a record can describe its own
// allocation. Content is fixed once an extent is chosen, so d records need
// p = ceil(d/capacity) pages, allocating those adds at most p more records, and
// the recomputation converges. A commit therefore writes its complete diff, and
// the in-memory set and the durable set are the same set — which is the
// property the tests assert after every commit, because its violation is what
// corrupts.
//
// Two failure directions are not symmetric. Under-reporting free space leaks
// and is recoverable; over-reporting hands out space a live page occupies and
// is not. Every bound here therefore refuses to reclaim rather than refusing to
// be exact: a full arena stops taking extents, an oversized diff folds instead
// of truncating, and a replay that cannot prove its result is disjoint fails.
//
// What the log costs per commit is a second question, and it is the one that
// decides whether this scales. Folding used to rewrite the whole image, so the
// image had to be small enough to rewrite — sixteen pages, about 2,700 extents,
// roughly 11 MiB of trackable free space at the 4 KiB page size — and a store
// that fragmented past that could no longer write down space it had reclaimed.
// The image is now a set of independently addressed segments named by an index,
// a fold rewrites only the segments a commit changed, and what must fit inside
// one commit is a directory of the free set rather than the free set. See
// foldFreeLog for the mechanics and internal/storeio/free_index.go for the
// durable shape.

	// freeReclaimBatch bounds how many retired extents one commit folds into the
