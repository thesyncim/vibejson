// Recovery is the one entry point that must accept bytes it did not write.
//
// Every other durable code path starts from a file this package produced, so a
// test can always say what the right answer is. Open cannot: it is handed a file
// by the operating system, and a torn write, a truncated copy, a half-restored
// backup, or a genuinely hostile file all arrive the same way. The contract for
// all of them is the same and is not "recover the data" — it is that the process
// survives, in bounded time, and that a store which does open never answers with
// something it could not have stored.
//
// So the assertion is internal consistency rather than a value oracle. There is
// no oracle for arbitrary bytes, but there is one for a store's own answers: the
// chunk-tree scan and the key directory are two independent traversals of the
// same collection, so they must agree, and whatever they return must be a
// document the store could have accepted in the first place, which means valid
// JSON. Either of those failing means recovery admitted a page it should have
// rejected.
