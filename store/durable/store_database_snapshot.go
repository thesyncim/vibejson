// A DatabaseSnapshot is a logically immutable view of every collection in a
// [Database] at one instant. Its zero value is an empty snapshot.
//
// It must be closed. Unlike a heap [store.DatabaseSnapshot], which retains
// nothing but Go pointers, this one holds one generation lease per collection,
// and a lease blocks reuse of every extent its collection's writer retires
// after the snapshot was taken. Holding one open across a sustained write loop
// fills Options.MaxRetiredExtents on every collection it covers, not just one.
// Prefer one database snapshot per query.
//
// # What the cut guarantees
//
// This is the paragraph to read before relying on the word "consistent", and it
// is worth being exact, because the guarantee is strong in one direction and
// deliberately silent in another.
//
// Every collection's lease is acquired while every collection's snapshotGate is
// held on its read side. A commit takes that gate's write side across the
// instant it swaps its collection's state pointer, so for the whole interval
// during which this snapshot loads state pointers and acquires leases, no
// collection in the database can publish. The set of generations captured is
// therefore a set that genuinely coexisted: there is no pair of collections A
// and B for which the snapshot holds a generation of A that had already been
// replaced when the captured generation of B was published. That is the absence
// of snapshot skew, and it is exactly what a join needs — a join resolving
// references against a state its driving side never saw would return rows that
// were never simultaneously true, and this makes that unrepresentable rather
// than merely unlikely.
//
// The leases are what carry the cut forward in time. Once acquired, each pins
// its collection's captured generation against the extent reclaimer, so every
// page the snapshot may read stays readable no matter how many commits land
// afterwards. The cut is thus consistent at capture and stable thereafter, and
// those are two separate mechanisms — the gates give the first, the leases the
// second — which is why both are needed and why neither alone would do.
//
// # What the cut does not guarantee
//
// It does not make separate writes atomic. A Database has no cross-collection
// transaction: an application that puts one document into orders and then
// another into customers has performed two independent commits, and a snapshot
// may legitimately fall between them. The snapshot is consistent with respect
// to the database's own commits, not with respect to an application's intent
// spanning several of them.
//
// It does not survive a crash. A lease is process memory, not a durable
// reservation. After a restart each collection recovers to its own last
// committed generation, and because those commits were independent, the
// recovered set need not be a cut this snapshot would ever have produced.
// Consistency here is a read-time property of a running process.
//
// It is not a timestamp, and this is the limitation that matters for where the
// engine might go next. The cut is established by mutual exclusion: it works
// because every writer to every collection in the database must pass through a
// gate that this process holds. A distributed version has no such gate — locks
// do not cross machines, and a remote writer cannot be made to block on a
// mutex here — so the same guarantee would have to be rebuilt on a
// timestamp-based cut: a version counter each collection's commit stamps its
// state with, and a read that selects, per collection, the newest state at or
// below a chosen cut timestamp. That is a different mechanism with a different
// cost profile (it needs multi-version retention rather than momentary
// exclusion), and it is deliberately not what this is. Nothing here should be
// read as a step toward it.

// untouched and single-collection [Collection.Snapshot] is unchanged.
