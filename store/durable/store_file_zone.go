// Per-chunk zone maps for the durable backend.
//
// The heap backend has carried chunk summaries since store/store_zone.go; this
// file is the same tier for a collection whose chunks are on disk, which is
// where block pruning is actually worth something. On the heap a pruned chunk
// is a scan avoided. Here it is a page never faulted, and at a low enough
// selectivity that is the difference between a query that reads the collection
// and a query that reads its directory.
//
// Three questions had to be answered that the heap backend never faced.
//
// # Where the summary lives
//
// In the chunk directory's radix leaf, beside the reference it describes — not
// in the chunk page (which would have to be read to be pruned, defeating the
// purpose), and not in a parallel structure (which would cost its own pages to
// read and write, and its own commit ordering to get wrong).
//
// The leaf is the page a reader must open anyway to learn where a chunk lives,
// so probing costs no read the scan was not already going to pay. It is also
// the page a writer must rewrite anyway when a chunk moves, and every chunk
// mutation moves its chunk: the format is copy-on-write, so a Put allocates a
// new document extent and rewrites the root-to-leaf directory path to point at
// it. The summary rides along in bytes the commit was already writing.
//
// The price is 30 bytes a lane — all a full 64-lane leaf has left in a
// 4096-byte page — which buys three tracked paths rather than the heap's
// eight, at 24-bit rather than 32-bit resolution. store_zone_compact.go
// argues why each of those losses is sound.
//
// # What it costs the write path
//
// Nothing in pages and one fold in CPU. A Put already rebuilds its chunk page
// and already rewrites its directory path; the summary adds no allocation, no
// page, and no fsync. The CPU is one linear pass over the document being
// written — the same merge-only, O(1)-in-chunk-size discipline store_zone.go
// uses, for the same reason: a summary that re-read the chunk's other 63
// documents would multiply the dominant cost of the write path instead of
// adding to it.
//
// The one case that does re-read is a chunk whose carried-forward summary is
// stale — a chunk that has never had one, which today means a chunk a bulk
// build published. That rebuild happens once per chunk, on the first commit
// that touches it, out of rows the commit already has in hand.
//
// # How it survives a crash
//
// By not being a separate thing that can disagree. The summary is in the same
// page, under the same checksum, allocated in the same write transaction, and
// published by the same state-root commit as the chunk reference it describes.
// A torn write fails the leaf's checksum and the whole generation is
// discarded; a crash before the superblock switch leaves the previous state
// root, whose leaves carry the previous summaries beside the previous
// references. There is no ordering to get wrong because there is no second
// write to order.
//
// The remaining risk is not physical but logical: a summary that is sound for
// a chunk it no longer describes. That is prevented by construction too —
// every path that publishes a chunk extent goes through
// [storeio.UpsertChunkTreeZone] with a merger, or through it without one, and
// without one the lane's summary is reset to "no statistics" rather than left
// pointing at the previous chunk's values.

// fileZoneMerger folds a commit's chunk rebuild into the summary the rewritten
// directory leaf will carry. One lives on each Collection and is reused, so
// handing it to storeio as an interface costs no allocation.
