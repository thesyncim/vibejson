// bytes. It is a space-against-scan-speed decision, the two options are far
// apart on both axes, and which one a workload wants is not obvious, so it is

//
// Measured on 100,000 documents averaging 299 bytes, Apple M4 Max, medians of
// -count=6, both files written by CreateFrom from the same source collection:
//
//	                          verbatim   compact
//	file size                 52.7 MiB   27.1 MiB
//	... as a multiple of raw JSON  1.85x     0.95x
//	full scan, warm, ns/doc         6.2      81.3
//	point read, warm, ns            904      1234
//	full scan, cold, ns/doc         287       450
//	cold scan device reads         1586       805
//
// So compact costs roughly thirteen times the resident scan and a third more
// per point read, and returns just under half the bytes on disk.
//
// The cold row is the one that is easy to get backwards. Compact reads half as
// much from the device, and it is still slower cold, because on this hardware
// the token decoding costs more than the I/O it saves. That balance is a
// property of the storage, not of the format: on a slow or contended device,
// or with a resident budget far below the corpus, halving the bytes read can
// invert it. Measure it on the device you will deploy on rather than assuming
// either direction. Note also that this cold measurement empties the buffer
// pool but not the operating system's page cache.
//
// One more caution about the space number, because two different comparisons
// are in circulation and they flatter differently. The 1.95x above is compact
// against this package's own verbatim output, and a similar ratio holds against
// a Put-built file. Against other embedded engines the result is much less
// impressive: on a shape-matched high-cardinality corpus the compact file grew
// 77% (15.9 -> 28.2 MiB) while bbolt, badger, and SQLite moved under 3%, which
// leaves compact level with them rather than ahead. Both statements are true
// and they answer different questions; quote the one that matches the question
// being asked.

// usually after "write every page exactly once", and should not silently
// receive an order-of-magnitude resident-scan regression they did not ask for.
