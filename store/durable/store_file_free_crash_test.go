// Fault injection for the durable free set.
//
// This subsystem has produced two severe failures in this project's history, and
// both were shaped like a torn write. One was a permanent write outage where
// reclamation refused to act and thereby removed its own drain. The other was a
// group commit that elided a root write holding a group's high-water extent,
// which made stores unopenable. Neither showed up in a clean-shutdown test.
//
// Two things changed here that make this coverage mandatory rather than
// thorough. The image is no longer a linked list that every fold replaced whole:
// a fold now writes some segments, republishes an index that names both the new
// pages and pages it did not touch, and truncates the delta chain — three
// dependent writes where there used to be one self-contained rewrite. And a
// retirement is now durable in the commit that makes it, so a torn commit can
// leave the file claiming an extent is free while the root that survived still
// points at it. That is the one failure this package cannot recover from:
// under-reporting free space leaks, over-reporting hands out live pages.
//
// So the assertion is not that the store opens. It is that whichever generation
// survived, every byte that generation's own free set advertises can be
// destroyed without the store noticing — which is the definition of "no extent
// is both live and free", stated as the failure rather than as a traversal.

// Given a commit torn at every write point, when the resulting image is
// recovered, then it opens at exactly one of the two generations, its free set
// replays and mirrors memory, every byte that free set advertises is provably
// dead, and the store can still write.
