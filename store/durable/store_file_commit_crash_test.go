// Fault injection for the whole commit, not just the free set.
//
// TestFileStoreFreeSetSurvivesCrashAtEveryWritePoint already tears a commit at
// every write point, but everything it asserts is about the free set: the store
// opens, the chain replays, and no advertised free byte is live. That is the
// right property for the free log and the wrong scope for the commit, because a
// commit now writes far more than it used to and the newest of those writes have
// no sweep at all. A batched Update publishes many mutations as one generation
// through tree descents that visit each page exactly once. Directory pages are
// validated at admission rather than per lookup, so a page that reaches the
// cache unvalidated is never checked again. Retirement pressure can abandon
// extents. None of that is exercised by tearing one Put and reading one key.
//
// The addition here is coverage that is stated in terms of page kinds and then
// proved. The sweep decodes every physical page a commit changed, records its
// kind, and fails if the kinds the commit path is made of were not among them —
// so "the key tree is covered" is an assertion about the images that were
// actually built, not a claim about the workload that was supposed to build
// them. On top of that every recovered image is checked against a stronger
// consistency property than the free-set sweep uses: the chunk-tree scan and the
// key-tree lookups must enumerate the same documents with the same bytes, the
// index postings must select exactly the rows whose documents hold the value,
// and all of that must survive having every byte the image's own free set
// advertises overwritten with garbage.
//
// The two historical failures this subsystem produced are both in range. A
// reclaimer that removed its own drain shows up as a store that opens and reads
// but cannot write; the probe write at the end of every image is what catches
// it. A group commit that elided a root write holding a group's high-water
// extent shows up as an image that will not open at all.

// It reads the file the way a forensic tool would rather than the way the store

// wrote and then failed to link is still found. That is deliberate. The point of
// this walk is to name what a commit put on disk, and a walk that started from
// the roots could only ever name what the roots already reach — which is the
