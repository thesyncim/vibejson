// Package store is the canonical keyed JSON store API.
//
// It contains the in-memory engine, immutable snapshots, optional schema and
// exact-index definitions, TTL, and bulk construction. Durable page-file
// storage lives in package store/durable.
//
// # Measuring a collection's footprint
//
// runtime.MemStats.HeapAlloc understates a loaded collection by roughly an
// order of magnitude, and this is by construction rather than by accident. A
// published collection keeps its documents — source bytes, structural tapes,
// key directory, and index pages — in pointer-free blocks that
// internal/storemem places outside the Go heap on common Unix platforms, so
// they are process RSS that HeapAlloc cannot see. A 100,000-document, 24 MiB
// corpus measured 3.9 MiB of HeapAlloc against 165 MiB of peak RSS. Read
// [Stats]'s External*Bytes fields for what the collection holds off-heap, and
// getrusage for the process total.
//
// The gap runs the other way during a load. Both write paths stage a chunk's
// source and structural tapes on the Go heap and only move them off it when the
// chunk is compacted, so the Go heap high-water mark — MemStats.HeapSys, not
// HeapAlloc — is what a bulk load actually costs, and it is several times the
// collection's steady state. A footprint measurement that reads HeapAlloc after
// the load has finished will see neither number.

// New validates options and returns an initialized in-memory collection. It
// freezes options immediately rather than deferring configuration errors or
// option capture to the first mutation, so no mutation can observe a
// misconfigured collection.
//
// The returned collection is standalone and unnamed; only
// [Database.CreateCollection] gives a collection a catalog name.
