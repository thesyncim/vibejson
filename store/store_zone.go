// Per-chunk zone maps: the block-pruning tier.
//
// Before this file the collection had pruning at exactly two granularities —
// the declared-index catalog (whole-index) and postings/index masks (single
// row) — and nothing in between. A predicate with no declared index therefore
// read and materialized every chunk in the collection no matter how selective
// it was. This file adds the tier every serious column store has between those
// two: a small, fixed-size summary of each immutable chunk that the planner
// consults to decide whether the chunk can be skipped without being read.
//
// # The conservative-pruning argument
//
// A chunk may be skipped only when it provably contains no matching row.
// Scanning a chunk that holds no match costs time; skipping a chunk that holds
// one is silent data loss, so every decision here is built so that the *only*
// error a summary can make is to be too wide.
//
// Soundness rests on one property: phi (zoneCode below) is a monotone map from
// the query's total order over JSON scalars (query/scalar.go's compareScalar)
// into uint32, and it is applied by the identical code to stored values and to
// query literals. Monotone means a <= b implies phi(a) <= phi(b); it does not
// have to be injective, and every place it loses information (a 29-bit number
// mantissa, a four-byte string prefix) loses it in a way that only merges
// distinct values onto one code, never reorders them.
//
// Given monotonicity, with mn = min over the chunk of phi(x) and mx = max:
//
//	x  = L  implies phi(x) == phi(L), so prune when phi(L) < mn or phi(L) > mx
//	x  > L  implies phi(x) >= phi(L), so prune when mx < phi(L)
//	x  < L  implies phi(x) <= phi(L), so prune when mn > phi(L)
//
// and symmetrically for >= and <=. Each implication is one-directional, which
// is exactly the direction pruning needs: a chunk survives whenever a match is
// still possible.
//
// Folding is allowed to be even more conservative than phi: a value is folded
// as a closed interval [lo, hi] known to contain phi(v), and mn/mx take the
// min of lo and the max of hi. That is what lets an escaped string, whose
// decoded prefix is not known without decoding it, be folded as "some string
// in this range" instead of forcing a decode on the write path.
//
// # Exact-decimal numbers
//
// query/scalar.go deliberately keeps 9007199254740992 and 9007199254740993
// distinct, so a naive float64 zone bound would be a false-negative generator:
// a chunk holding only ...93 has float64 max ...92, and `x > 9007199254740992`
// would prune a chunk that matches. The bound here is safe for a subtler
// reason than rounding slack. strconv.ParseFloat is correctly rounded, and
// correct rounding is a *monotone* function of the exact decimal value, so
// phi(number) = tag | top-29-bits-of-monotone-float-order(ParseFloat(s)) is
// monotone with respect to exact decimal order even though it is massively
// non-injective. The two integers above collapse onto one code; the pruning
// rules above tolerate that (they only ever conclude "may match"), and the
// per-row evaluator still separates them exactly. -0 is normalized to +0
// because the two are one value to compareScalar but two distinct bit
// patterns, and a phi that separated them would not be monotone.
//
// # Nulls
//
// Absence and explicit null are tracked as two separate bits, not one. They
// are genuinely different facts about a schemaless document, and EXISTS
// already distinguishes them (query/predicate.go's present()); only IS NULL
// unions them. Neither participates in min/max: evalCmp rejects a null cell
// before any comparison, so excluding nulls from the bounds is not merely
// space-saving — it lets a chunk in which a path is always null or always
// absent be pruned outright for every ordered predicate.

// ZonePaths bounds the number of distinct document paths one chunk keeps
// statistics for. This is the answer to the schemaless-metadata problem, and
// it is deliberately a hard cap rather than a policy that adapts:
//
// A schemaless collection has an unbounded path set, so any summary keyed by
// "every path ever seen" grows with the corpus's vocabulary rather than with
// its size, and metadata that can outgrow the data is a worse bug than the
// missing optimization it was meant to fix. The policy here is therefore
// bounded and first-come: the first ZonePaths *top-level* member names
// observed in a chunk get an entry, and once the table is full it never
// changes again for that chunk's lifetime.
//
// First-come and never-evict is not a convenience. It is what makes an entry
// sound. An entry for path A is created by the first document in the chunk
// that carries A; because the table only ever grows, no earlier document in
// that chunk can have carried A without having created the entry itself. That
// is the invariant that lets a late-created entry record "absent in the
// documents before me" instead of having to rescan them. An eviction policy —
// LRU, frequency, query-history-adaptive — would break it: a re-admitted path
// would have a summary covering only the documents seen since re-admission,
// and would prune chunks that match. Adaptivity was rejected for that reason
// first and because it would make on-disk content depend on query history
// second.
//
// Only top-level members are tracked. Nested paths are the other unbounded
// axis (a document of depth d with f fields per level has f^d paths), and
// enumerating them costs a full recursive walk per write, against a write path
// that is already the collection's bottleneck. Top-level enumeration is one
// linear pass over source bytes the writer has in hand.
